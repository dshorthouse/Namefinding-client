PREFACE. 



THE first Edition of Professor VAN DER HOEVEN'S manual 
was published in parts between the years 1827 and 1835. 
He undertook the labour, as he informs us, not with any 
desire to add one more to the numerous works with a 
similar title already in existence, which should be neither 
better nor worse than these. On the contrary, if he had 
found any one of them to be a sufficient guide for his 
public teaching, without great alterations, he would have 
abstained from his contemplated task. Accordingly, the 
plan of his work differed from that of most other manuals 
in beginning with the simpler forms of animals, and pro- 
ceeding upwards to the highest : and from that of all of 
them, in embodying a much larger amount of anatomical 
information. His work was received with marked appro- 
bation not confined to the limits of his own country. 
During the lapse of nineteen years, which intervened 
between the first and second editions, the acquisitions 
both of Zoology and Zootomy had been greatly enlarged, 
so that in many departments the former science had 
assumed an entirely new aspect. Consequently the second 



VI PKEFACE. 

edition, similar in plan to the first but greatly different in 
its contents, was almost entirely re-written. This edition 
has, like the first, been published in parts between the 
years 1846 and 1855, inclusive. From the high terms in 
which it has already been alluded to from time to time, 
in the writings of various active cultivators of different 
departments of Zoology on the continent, it is obvious 
that the general estimation of his work will still be such 
as might be expected in the case of an author of vast 
erudition, of appropriate tastes, talents and genius, and 
whose office it has been for nearly thirty years, as Pro- 
fessor of Zoology in the University of Leyden, to bring 
the value and import of the new acquisitions of Ana- 
tomy and Zoology (many of them the result of his own 
labours) from time to time before his auditors. 

The University of Cambridge, a few years ago, directed 
in a more marked manner the attention of our students to 
the Moral and Natural Sciences, by proposing honorary 
distinctions to those who might excel in certain depart- 
ments of those sciences respectively; and by requiring 
proof of satisfactory attention to some one at least of such 
departments on the part of all candidates for the degree 
of Bachelor of Arts, who were not aspirants for Mathe- 
matical honours. Amongst the departments of Natural 
Science, Comparative Anatomy and Physiology were 
indicated, with special regard (as is presumed) to Zoology. 
It thus became a part of my office to place within reach 



PREFACE. Vll 

of our students the best assistance I could recommend for 
their studies in this direction. In fulfilment of it I ap- 
plied to Professor VAN DER HOEVEN for his permission 
to translate his Work, in which I found all that could 
be required. He had the kindness not only to grant this 
permission, but also to enrich the English translation with 
numerous references to works too recent for notice in his 
own second edition. It is to be much regretted that his 
other engagements did not allow him, as I requested, 
to weave the new matter in his own terse and pleasing 
style into his introductions to the classes and elsewhere. 
Consequently such additions, in this respect, as are in- 
cluded within square brackets are mine. 

The study of Zoology is now in such general favour 
with cultivated persons in this country, that I believe the 
present work, from its scientific value and the interest of 
its historical and other notices, as well as from the con- 
tinuous references to the works of the original discoverers, 
will secure for itself, beyond the walls of Universities, a 
reception not unworthy of its Author's great name.

INTRODUCTION. 



WE often hear the word Nature used in such a way that it is 
difficult to know what meaning is attached to it. Some denote 
thereby the system of all the forces to which matter is subjected, 
and thus distinguish between Nature and the Universe; under- 
standing by the last the entire complex of created bodies. 
But such a distinction is quite arbitrary. The word Nature, 
introduced into modern languages from the Latin, is derived from 
nasci, to be born, to come into being 1 . In this sense we call the 
aggregate of all that comes, or has come, into being, and is for us 
an object of observation either by external sense or internal percep- 
tion, Nature the material world and the spiritual world Nature 
in space and Nature in thought. Finally we oppose Nature to Art, 
understanding by the last whatever change the intellect of man has 
induced upon the products of Creation, in order to satisfy his wants, 
or to enhance his enjoyments. 

However different these and other meanings may be, we may 
admit that to be the most general which defines nature as the 
material world, the world of matter, all that is created or has being, 
together with the forces inherent in the matter, and the laws 
according to which they act. The knowledge of this whole, so 
stupendously vast, the ancients named physica : and considered to 
be a part of the philosophy which they termed a science of divine 
and human things and of their causes. But though this science, like 
nature its object, be one, yet its great extent on the one hand and 
the narrowness of the human intellect on the other, has rendered 
the subdivision of it necessary. Yet the limits of the different 
natural sciences can scarcely, on account of their mutual relations,

2 INTRODUCTION. 

be 1 Defined with precision : and into whatever path we chance to 
strike, difficulties from the very nature of the case are unavoidable. 

The Natural Sciences relate either to Nature and her several 
products considered by themselves : or they teach us so to apply 
those products as to contribute to our service, or to satisfy our 
wants. The latter are called practical natural sciences, the former 
theoretical. To the practical natural sciences belong especially 
Agriculture and Technology : and they are founded upon the 
theoretical, of which the truths are applied only in a degree propor- 
tioned to the particular object that is had in view. They may 
therefore be called Applied Natural Sciences. Of the pure, or 
theoretical Natural Sciences there are several. To them belong 1 
Phenomenal Doctrine, Chemistry, and Natural History. What 
characterises such sciences and distinguishes them from each other 
lies less in the objects which belong to the province of each, than 
in the manner of considering them, and in the different direction 
of the enquiry. Metals, salts, earths belong as much to the province 
of Chemistry as to that of Natural History : but the chemist, in 
all these things, investigates only the matter and its properties, its 
affinities and combinations : the mineralogist is busied with their 
form, their natural occurrence, their classification. The chemist, 
moreover, investigates those elements which occur in nature only 
in combination with other matters : such elementary substances are 
excluded from the province of Natural History. 

Whilst Physics investigate the common properties of bodies, and 
the motions by which a temporary change is effected in their 
condition, Chemistry enquires into their component parts, the 
special properties of each elementary substance, and its various 
combinations with other elementary substances. Natural History, 
finally, arranges the bodies occurring in Nature according to form. 
In a certain sense, therefore, it may be termed a special Phenomenal 
Doctrine : but its essence lies in describing and classifying. It is 
ordinarily limited to the bodies which occur upon the surface of 
our earth, or at small depths below and accessible by mining : but 
it is by no means necessary thus to limit it. It depends upon the

under the form of laws and principles." Vid. WHEWELL'S History of the Inductive 
Sciences, and his Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, passim.] Tr.

manner of treating it alone, to include within its province not only 
the planet which we inhabit, but even the whole visible universe 1 . 
The certainty to which we can attain in this science is grounded 
upon the testimony of our own senses, on that of other observers, 
and upon conclusions, drawn from the combination of particular 
observations (Induction) : of which conclusions the security is 
increased in proportion to the number of observed phenomena 
which tend to their establishment ; for observation is the principal 
foundation upon which this science is raised. 



Organic and Inorganic Bodies. 

A primary division of the bodies of our earth is that according 
to which they are separated into organic (organica), and inorganic 
(anorganica). Inorganic bodies can grow, or increase in bulk, only 
by external addition of homogeneous parts ; they possess no hetero- 
geneous parts, though they may be composed of several chemical 
elements. In their perfect condition they ordinarily present regular 
forms, which are bounded by planes and straight lines. The 
knowledge of them is the object of Mineralogy. 

The remaining bodies are called organic, because they consist 
of different parts, of fibres, vessels, cells, &c., the combination of 
which is called organisation. In these bodies there prevails that 
mutual dependence between all the parts, of which, in the inorganic, 
we recognise no trace. In these last, each of the parts exists for 
itself, and when separated from the whole does not cease to be the 
same that the whole was before. As to form, the boundaries which 
circumscribe plants and animals are very generally round surfaces 
and curved lines, very rarely straight lines and planes. 

Organic beings present phenomena which are called ' Vital 
Phenomena,' of which the most general consist in an incessant 
susception of new matters, in the formation of new parts and 
organs (Growth, Development, Reproduction), and in the production 
of similar beings (Propagation). The separation of those constitu- 
ents of food that are unfit for nutriment, and of matters that have 
been changed through the action of life, and are no longer fitted for

its support, supplies the means by wliich the peculiar chemical 
composition, characteristic of each individual being, is preserved; 
at death, on the cessation of this interchange of matter, the organic 
substance passes into solution or putrefaction. Instead of those 
complex combinations of elements, which form the proximate con- 
stituents of organic bodies, simpler combinations arise, which being 
taken up by the air or the earth, become anew the vital stimulants 
and the nutriment of that vegetable world, on whose existence the 
life of animals is dependent. Thus we perceive here an interchange 
of matter on a large scale, as we do in every organic being on a 
small one : and perishableness becomes the means whereby new life 
and fresh youth are effused over the whole of nature 1 . 



Plants and Animals. 

The above may suffice to give a general notion of organised 
bodies. It scarcely requires notice that the term includes plants 
and animals. 

At first sight it seems easy to distinguish an animal from a 
plant : and even the most unskilled person thinks he has a clear 
notion of the difference. Yet it is just his want of knowledge that 
causes the difference to appear so prominent : whilst he overlooks 
the intermediate links, and thinks, for instance, of a dog and a 
pear-tree. There are two sorts of judgment with conviction. Such 
a judgment may arise either from want of knowledge, or from pro- 
found insight, the result of long and accurate investigation. Who- 
ever seeks after truth must learn to sacrifice the first, even though 
he may never attain to the second. 

Animals are usually considered as more composite and more 
perfect than plants. Yet when we compare the simple substance of 
which Infusory Animals and Polypi are composed with the orderly 
and beautiful structure of the higher plants, we become satisfied 
that this proposition is far from having a general value. 

It is said, plants are rooted in the ground, and by this token 
are sufficiently distinguished from animals. But it is here over- 
looked, that there are free-swimming water-plants, just as there are 



Ut opus natures perenni flore rideat." LINN>EUS. 



PLANTS AND ANIMALS. 5 

animals that live in water fast fixed to a given spot. Again, it was 
imagined that plants might be distinguished from animals by their 
possessing only at certain times the parts which serve for the main- 
tenance of the species. But all animals have not organs of propa- 
gation during the whole of their existence : insects acquire them 
only in the latest period of their lives, like plants that only flower 
once. It is true that Anatomy points out the rudiments of these 
future organs in the Larvae of Insects : but this does not prevent 
the Larvas of Insects from being termed, in a certain sense, sex-less. 
Moreover many plants and animals are propagated only by spon- 
taneous fission, or by buds, without possessing proper parts sub- 
servient to propagation. To me the difference of Nutrition appears 
of more importance. It has been observed that Plants live on inor- 
ganic matters, Animals, on the other hand, on organic. Some 
animals, it is true, seem to live on earth. SCHWAMMERDAM believes 
mud to be the nutrient matter of the worm or larva of the Ephemera, 
and never found any other food in its intestinal canal. PALLAS could 
find nothing but fine sand in the intestine of Thalassema echiurus. 
I might allege several other examples, but will only add that man 
himself sometimes lives upon earth. At least the celebrated HUM- 
BOLDT tells of a people on the banks of the Oronoco and Meta that, 
when the waters are low, live upon fish and turtle : but as soon 
as the streams begin to swell and fishing to become laborious, 
devour, during a season which lasts for two or three months, enor- 
mous quantities of earth. The earth which these people eat is a 
fat soft clay, which they knead into lumps and burn on the outside 
at a slow fire, and again moisten when required for use. This 
observation however, now that microscopic investigation has dis- 
covered in different deposits and kinds of earth entire strata of 
living or fossil organic beings, admits of another explanation 1 . 
That earth may have contained organic constituents, as was the 
case with the earth that, mixed with meal and leaves of trees, was 
baked for bread on the failure of the crops in the year 1832 in the 
north of SJcandinavta, and in which RETZIUS discovered nineteen 
different forms of Infusories, or rather of the fossil remains of these 
animals. In the same way, the mud and sand, found in the intes-

6 INTRODUCTION. 

tinal canal of insects and worms, can scarcely be devoid of organic 
components. In general it cannot be contested that the vegetable 
kingdom prepares from inorganic nature those substances which 
serve for nutriment to the animal kingdom. Albumen and Fibrin, 
the principal constituents of the blood of animals, are already 
present in the parts of plants which they consume. But still, on the 
other hand, there are plants which grow on other plants, and thus 
apply to their own development the matters which have been pre- 
pared by those organic bodies. 

Scruples arising from such considerations must not mislead us 
to consider plants and animals as belonging to one and the same 
kingdom. Perhaps the following remarks may help to distinguish 
them from each other. 

If we consider the nutrition, we perceive that animals convey 
their food by one or more apertures into a common cavity, the 
stomach or intestinal canal, from which the prepared matters are 
absorbed and applied to the nutrition of the whole body. Thus the 
intestinal canal is for animals what the soil and air are for plants. 
The plant is consequently so constructed that its surface has the 
greatest possible extension : in the animal all is contrived for union 
round a center. Moreover the plant, which receives nutriment by 
means of its surface and the parts there situated, (pores, hairs, &c.) 
has no need to seek for food : it lives in the midst of its food : when 
this is deficient it cannot move and must consequently die. The 
animal, on the contrary, is destined to seek its food, which it must 
conduct into its intestinal canal : it moves therefore when nutriment 
is deficient. Let it not be here objected that plants move towards 
the light, and send larger roots towards the side where moisture is 
more abundant for this would be to confound growth with motion. 
The stimulants (light, moisture, &c.) act upon the plant, and there- 
fore its growth is more vigorous in that direction. The animal has 
independent motion which is excited by internal stimuli. Hence 
sensation is ascribed to animals. In the higher animals it is known 
that the contraction of the muscles is under the influence of the 
nervous system : that the stimuli, of whatever kind, if they pro- 
duce motion, act upon the nerves and through these upon the 
muscles. Comparative Anatomy, it is true, has, in some animals, 
hitherto failed to demonstrate a nervous system; but it does not 
therefore follow that these animals do not possess sensation, any 



ZOOLOGY. 7 

more than it follows that their want of muscular fibre justifies us 
in denying to them voluntary motion, which the unprejudiced 
observer may recognise even in the most simple animals. 

As to chemical composition Nitrogen, it is true, is not ex- 
clusively an animal principle: but still it occurs as an ultimate 
constituent of animal organisation in much greater quantity than 
in plants. In plants, on the other hand, Carbon is predominant. 

Not long ago, it was believed that a transition from Plant-Life 
to Animal-Life had been observed 1 . L. C. TREVIRANUS had 
remarked that the spores of Confervas move like Infusories 2 . A 
few years since UNGER described this phenomenon in Vaucheria 
clavata, and thought that he had surprised plants at the very 
moment of their becoming animals 3 . These sporidia move by 
means of cilia, but cannot on that account be considered animals 4 . 
Kather ought we, from such instances, to conclude that cilia are no 
exclusive character of the animal kingdom. The same may be said 
of a similar motion which GRANT observed in sponges, which, as 
little, on that account, are animals. 

As we have already remarked above, the difference between 
plants and animals will always be more apparent as the organisa- 
tion becomes more perfect and more complicated: the difficulty 
occurs in the case of the most simple vegetable and animal forms ; 
and here may be applied what Ovid says of the change of colour in 
the rainbow, 

Usque adeo quod tangit idem est, tamen ultima distant. 

Met. vi. 67. 



Zoology. 

There are three parts of Natural History, as there are three 
great divisions of the bodies which occur on our Earth. We sepa- 
rate Natural History into Mineralogy, Botany and Zoology, as we

INTRODUCTION. 

divide nature into three kingdoms, that of minerals, of plants, and 
of animals. 

As the history of mankind does not result from a collection of 
biographies, so Natural History is not formed by the description of 
animal species. Therefore Zoology describes not merely the sepa- 
rate animals (monographically) according to external parts and 
internal structure, but it comprises the entire kingdom of animals, 
denotes their mutual relations, and assigns to each animal its rank 
and position. 

Zoology falls into different parts. First, it is divided into 
Description and History. Description of animals (zoographia) sup- 
plies precise descriptions of the separate internal and external parts 
of the animal body, and thus of the entire animal. In a narrower 
sense, it makes us acquainted with the external parts and the ex- 
ternal form of the animal, and with the distribution into classes 
and orders. When it makes us acquainted with the internal struc- 
ture of animals, as well in respect of form and position (structura) 
as of tissue (textura), it is called the Anatomy of Animals (Zootomia), 
which has been especially cultivated of late years, and is generally 
named Comparative Anatomy (Anatomia Comparata}. But this ap- 
pellation has not exactly the same meaning as the first : it denotes, 
rather, a philosophical science, which, not content with the simple 
knowledge of the different forms, investigates, by comparison of the 
anatomy of all animals and also of the human body, the general 
laws of animal organisation and its unity. 

The History of Animals (Historia Animalium) comprehends a 
comparative history of the nature and intellect of animals : it illus- 
trates the phsenomena of life, and their obedience to law in the 
animal economy. It may be also termed General Physiology 
(Biology}. The knowledge of the geographical and physical dis- 
tribution of animals over the surface of the earth, the knowledge 
of the series of forms which in earlier periods inhabited our planet, 
and of which the remains have been found in beds and strata of 
rocks deposited from water, also belong to the History of the Ani- 
mal Kingdom. 

These subdivisions cannot dispense with mutual assistance. 
Conjointly they form only one science which we term Zoology. 



ANIMAL TISSUES. 

The Tissues of Animals. 

Nature, in the structure of animals, has exhibited inconceivable 
resources of art. Not only is the body as a whole, not only are its 
grosser parts, but even the smallest parts of the organs are ma- 
chinery; and the knife of the anatomist exhibits to us, even to the 
simplest fibre, nothing but parts constructed for a purpose. The 
whole body consists of many members : the members themselves 
consist of muscles, vessels, and nerves; the muscles again qf 
tissues, vessels, fibres, &c. Such a body may well be called 
organised. 

In order to form an idea of the texture of animals, we must go 
to work as the chemist does. He divides the parts which compose 
bodies into proximate and ultimate constituents, and terms those 
constituents ultimate, or elements (elemental), which by his art he 
can separate no further into heterogeneous parts. In the same way 
we find in the textures of animals proximate and ultimate con- 
stituents. Of the last, or the organic elements (elementa organica], 
we shall speak hereafter : the first question is what are the proxi- 
mate constituents? (paries constituentes proximce). They are called 
Tissues (Tefa). 

BICH AT was the founder v of the science of the organic tissues in 
man, and named it General Anatomy. In the investigation of the 
tissues he had recourse to chemical reagents, to maceration and 
partial decomposition in water. He described each tissue according 
to its physical and chemical properties, its physiological pheno- 
mena and its morbid changes. After him this science was ad- 
vanced by MECKEL, HEUSINGER, and BECLARD 1 in the same spirit. 
Within the last ten years it has received a totally different direction 
through microscopic research. By means of it General Anatomy 
has become, for the most part, Microscopic Anatomy. Our immortal 
LEEUWENHOECK, about a century and a half ago, had collected 
much material which remained almost unused; until, in our day, 
with the improvement of the compound microscope, a more general 
interest in such enquiries has been excited, and the importance of 
the knowledge of the minutest organic constituents to accurate

named author : EUmens d' A natomie generate (a me e*dit. Paris, 1827. 8vo.) 



10 INTRODUCTION. 

Physiology been gradually recognised. We cannot omit mention- 
ing the names of KRAUSE, VALENTIN, SCHWANN, HENLE in pre- 
ference to many others whom we could willingly refer to in this 
field of enquiry 1 . We must limit ourselves to a short survey, 
and will rather enumerate than describe the different Tissues. A 
complete description, however compressed, would demand more 
space than is consistent with the nature of this manual. 

I. Conjunctive Tissue (tela conjunctiva), ordinarily Cellular 
Membrane or Areolar Tissue, called also by others Formative 
Tissue, occupies almost everywhere the space between the 
different parts, and forms, according to Cuvier's well-selected 
comparison, a kind of sponge, which has the same shape as 
the whole body which it contributes to form. By long 
boiling it is dissolved into glue. It consists of bundles of 
threads, and has no resemblance to the cellular tissue of 
plants which consists of hexagonal cells. The threads are 
long, have a somewhat tortuous course and an extreme 
tenuity (about -^ millim.) 2 . 

II. Adipose Tissue (tela adiposa). Formerly this constituent 
was not distinguished from the former; it was considered 
to be cellular tissue containing fat. But it is quite neces- 
sary to distinguish between them. This tissue consists of 
vesicles or cells, which, compared with other elementary 
parts of the animal body, are pretty large (about g . . . ^ mil- 
lim.). Fat is, with the exception of some constituents of 
milk in the class mammalia, the only non-azotized substance 
of the 'animal body and, like most vegetable constituents, 
rich in Carbon. Fat, except in situations where it occurs 
as a distinct membrane, forms in the combined state a con- 
stituent of different tissues and of many animal fluids. 
III. Vascular Tissue (tela vascularis}. Vessels are hollow cylin- 
ders, which contain nutrient fluids that circulate through 
the body. To these belong the Lymphatics as well as the 
blood-vessels. The larger blood-vessels are composed of 



1 Here too it may suffice to refer to a single work of eminence. J. HENLE, Alge- 
meine Anatomic, Lehre von der Mischung's-und Formbestandtheilen des menscJdichen 
Korpers. Leipzig, 1841. 8vo. 

[ 2 A millimeter is about half an English line, or the 24th part of an inch.] 



ANIMAL TISSUES. 11 

different layers : the finest vessels (called Capillaries) of a 
single uniform membrane, without fibres or other tissue, 
but in which lie round or oblong microscopic corpuscles 
(cell-nuclei). In the larger blood-vessels, and also in the 
lymphatics, the innermost coat is formed of cells, which, 
as in the Cuticle, lie side by side, pavement-fashion. This 
coat is covered by others which present fibres partly longi- 
tudinal, partly circular. Then comes the most external 
layer of conjunctive tissue, which connects the vessels with 
the neighbouring parts. 

IV. Nervous Tissue (tela nervea). To this belongs in the higher 
animals, the brain, the spinal cord, the ganglia and the 
nerves: inferior animals have only nerves and ganglia, 
which last take the place of the central parts of the nervous 
system. The chemical constituents of this tissue are 
Albumen and a species of Fat containing Phosphorus. 
The nerve-stems and the bundles of which they consist, 
are surrounded with coats of conjunctive tissue, called 
Neurilema : dilute muriatic acid dissolves the neurilema : 
alkaline solutions, on the contrary, cause the nervous 
medulla to disappear, the neurilema remaining alone. The 
nerves consist of fine threads, which neither subdivide, nor 
anastomose with each other. They are of very unequal 
thickness, ^ ... to j~ millim. and less, especially in the 
nerves of sense. Besides these threads there are found 
corpuscles with nuclei : these present themselves in the 
ganglia and in the grey substance of the brain and spinal 
cord. These ganglion-corpuscles are very dissimilar in 
form and size, mostly ^ . . . ^ millim. 

V. Horny Tissue (tela cornea). The parts consisting of this 
tissue have neither blood-vessels nor nerves. Cuticle, nails, 
hair, feathers, horns and scales belong hereto. They lie on 
the surface of the body, whilst a covering (epithelium} , resem- 
bling Cuticle, lines the inner surface of the mucous membranes 
(as of the stomach) and also of the internal closed cavities 
and sacs, as well as of the vessels (see above, III. Vase. 
Tis.). The Cuticle, or Epidermis, consists of microscopic flat 
cells joining on to each other like a pavement, and of which 
each contains a nucleus. Water swells up the epidermis, 



12 INTRODUCTION. 

boiling leaves it unchanged, by concentrated sulphuric acid 
it is dissolved gradually, by alkalis readily. Scales, nails, 
&c., which consist of this tissue, are secreted by a highly 
vascular bed (matrix) in layers. The Epithelium is formed 
in part, like the Epidermis, of flat cells : in other situations 
these cells are cylindrical, or conical, and stand perpen- 
dicularly, side by side, like fibres. In many situations (as 
the nasal cavities, the respiratory organs of mammalia, birds 
and reptiles, the gills of bivalve molluscs) these conical cells 
carry cilia, whose motions had been seen on the surface of 
the body of many of the lower animals by the earlier 
observers, but were distinctly recognised by PURKINJE and 
VALENTIN as a very general phenomenon of the animal 
kingdom only a few years ago. 

VI. Cartilaginous Tissue (tela cartilaginea) is semi-transparent, 
elastic, and mostly of a bluish-white colour. On section it 
presents a very smooth surface and looks like a substance of 
uniform density. But under the microscope, small, granular, 
round or oblong corpuscles are seen in the clearer trans- 
parent principal mass. The glue which is obtained from 
cartilage by boiling differs in many respects from the glue 
of bone, and was called by MUELLER, who first called atten- 
tion to the difference, Chondrine (cartilage-glue}. This glue 
is also obtained from the cornea of the eye, which is com- 
posed of many thin layers or plates formed of fibres that 
cross one another in all directions. Certain yellow highly 
flexible and elastic cartilages contain numerous fibres (carti- 
lagines fibrosce}'. to this division belongs ex. gr. the cartilage 
of the external ear in man and mammalia. Cartilage con- 
tains two-thirds of its weight of water. In the ash are 
found carb. soda, sulph. soda, and carb. lime as the chief 
constituents. Here belongs : 

Osseous Tissue (tela ossea). The tissue of bone is hard 
and opaque, and of a laminated structure. The chief con- 
stituents are cartilage, which on boiling passes entirely into 
gelatin or common glue: and bone-earth, of which the 
quantity increases with the age. The last consists princi- 
pally of phosphate of lime, which has a great affinity with 
the colouring matter of madder, so that the bones of animals 



ANIMAL TISSUES. 13 

fed on it acquire a red colour. Bone may be freed of its 
lime by acids (ex. gr. dilute muriatic acid). The cartilage 
which remains has in general the structure of permanent 
cartilage : the bones also, in the first period of life, corre- 
spond to cartilage, and previous to ossification (i. e. before 
the bone is hardened by the phosphate of lime) the glue 
which they contain is also Chondrine, which is precipitated 
by alum, acetic acid and the sulphate of alumina. In the 
bones are found small medullary canals communicating 
with one another (i . . . n millim.) which are connected with 
the medullary cavities, or the cellular spaces in the middle 
of the bone, and. give to the bone a streaky or fibrous 
appearance visible to the naked eye. These canals are 
surrounded by several layers, which lie included between 
the other layers or plates that, in the flat bones, are arranged 
in the direction of their surface, and in the long bones in a 
circular form round their internal medullary cavity. These 
medullary canals contain fat and minute blood-vessels. 
Between the layers are found microscopically small oval 
corpuscles, resembling cartilage-corpuscles, and from which 
extremely fine tubules, partly branching, proceed. These 
parts, when treated with acids, become quite transparent, 
and their granular content is consequently bone-earth. 
VII. Muscular Tissue (tela muscularis). Muscles consist of 
bundles of fibres : the primitive bundles, which consist of 
some hundreds of fibres, are by means of conjunctive tissue 
(cellular tissue) collected into larger bundles, and these again 
into still larger. Muscular tissue belongs to the albuminous 
substances. Flesh becomes harder by boiling : on cooling 
the decoction becomes gelatinous from the glue into which 
the cellular tissue has been changed. If finely-divided 
flesh be pressed, a red acid fluid is obtained, which contains 
albumen, the colouring matter of blood, lactic acid, salts, 
and ozmazom. The red colour of muscles (in animals that 
breathe by lungs) is heightened by exposure to light ; some 
ascribe this solely to the blood. It is not a common 
character of this tissue: in fishes the flesh is white: the 
muscles of many articulata are brownish, yellow, or light 
red. Muscles are distinguished into two kinds. There are 



14 INTRODUCTION. 

muscles with varicose structure of the primitive fibres, and 
fine transverse stripes of the primitive bundles. This is 
the structure of the muscles of voluntary motion amongst 
vertebrate and articulate animals, and of the muscles of the 
heart. These fibres are very fine, ^ millim. and less, and 
are amongst the finest parts of the animal organism. Other 
muscles consist of coarser fibres ^...^5 millim. which are 
not jointed or varicose, and which correspond to the primi- 
tive bundles of the former. In these therefore no transverse 
stripes are seen. To these belong the muscular fibres of the 
intestinal canal, also the red fibres of the muscular stomach 
of birds. Usually these muscles of organic life have a 
pale and somewhat yellow colour. Muscular tissue has the 
property of contracting, upon the application of a stimulus, 
in the direction of its fibres. This irritability (irritabilitas) 
is a vital property, and is distinct from the elastic contrac- 
tility, which other parts of the body retain even after death. 

VIII. Elastic Tissue (tela elastica). This tissue has much resem- 
blance to conjunctive tissue, and holds, as it were, an inter- 
mediate position between it and muscular tissue. The fibres 
are of unequal size (155 ... 555 millim.) and have a serpentine 
course : they divide frequently and unite at many points with 
branches from other fibres, whence a reticulate distribution 
arises. The colour of this tissue is yellow: it retains its 
elasticity unaltered by keeping in spirit of wine, or by 
boiling for several days. After long boiling it gives a small 
quantity of a peculiar glue which in some points agrees with 
cartilage-glue. The cervical ligament of mammals is com- 
posed of this tissue : also in arteries a layer of elastic fibres 
lies between the circular fibrous coat and the external coat 
of cellular tissue : in large trunks this layer may be clearly 
distinguished as a continuous membrane. The yellow 
ligaments on the arches of the vertebrae, and the ligaments 
of the trachea, also consist of elastic tissue. But not merely 
as separate ligaments or membranes, but also mingled with 
other tissues, elastic fibres are met with in different situa- 
tions, as for instance, in serous membranes and in skin. 
We have here spoken only of those tissues which occur most 

generally. We have not noticed Dental Tissue because, whilst we 



ANIMAL TISSUES. 15 

treat of the entire animal kingdom, it occurs only partially. Other 
tissues, which ordinarily receive special notification, may be re- 
duced to one or other of the foregoing. Tendinous Tissue belongs 
to Conjunctive Tissue, as does that of Skin proper (corium) : to this 
also belongs in part Mucous Tissue (in the intestinal canal, &c.) 
The Serous Membranes merit a special mention. They serve to 
line cavities in the interior of the body, and ordinarily form sacs 
which are closed on every side. They, too, belong to Conjunctive 
Tissue, and are smooth only on their free surface, which is covered 
with an epithelium. This smooth surface secretes a serous fluid. 
We cannot admit a proper Glandular Tissue (tela glandulosa), as 
most authors do. Under the term Gland Anatomists arrange very 
different parts, of which the consideration belongs to special and 
descriptive Anatomy. Lymph-glands (glandules lymphatics s. con- 
globatce) which are found only in higher animals, are round or 
oblong bodies of different size, in which one or more lymphatics are 
distributed; these tortuous branches are again collected into larger 
vessels, which pass out on the opposite side of the gland, to pursue 
their course onward: numerous blood-vessels, whose fineness ex- 
ceeds that of the lymphatics, surround all these branches. Conse- 
quently lymph-glands are only vascular networks, and may be put 
on a level with the so-called Eetia Mirabilia of the blood-vessels. 
In the class of Glands, moreover, are reckoned different parts of 
the animal body which, apart from their coverings, consist of con- 
junctive tissue, blood-vessels and nerves, and for the most part have 
an internal closed cavity which is filled with a granular fluid. 
Such are the Supra-renal Capsules, the Thyroid gland, the Spleen, 
the Thymus gland. These are the parts which HEUSINGER com- 
prises under the name of parenchymatous tissue under which, 
however, he also classes other parts, as the Lymphatics and the 
Ovaries. Other authors style these parts Blood-glands (ganglia 
sanguineo-vasculosa) , comparing them with the lymph-glands (gan- 
glia lymphatico-vasculosd) ; but since these parts are not distin- 
guished from others by their blood-vessels, the comparison is arbi- 
trary. Finally, in a more special manner, the term gland is applied 
to those parts of the animal body which secrete a fluid that does not 
return into the current of the blood. These, in addition to lym- 
phatics blood-vessels nerves and conjunctive tissue, have an efferent 
canal (ductus excretorius} formed of mucous membrane, for the 



16 INTRODUCTION. 

passage of the secreted fluid, which is conveyed into the intestinal 
canal or to the surface of the body. This efferent canal receives, 
like an arterial trunk, the finer canals which effect the secretion, 
and which are covered with epithelium. To such belong the 
kidneys, the liver, the salivary glands, &c. 

From what has been said, it is obvious that we cannot adopt 
that division of the Tissues which an esteemed writer 1 has pro- 
posed: into simple, constituent, and compound tissues. Doubtless 
every muscle contains nerves and blood-vessels, but nerves and 
blood-vessels are not on that account constituents of muscular 
tissue. According to our view, every tissue is simple, but it may, 
either by itself, form special parts, or only in combination with 
other parts. The corneous tissue is the only one which comes 
under the first head : all other tissues form this or that part, only 
in combination with one another : nervous tissue, for instance, does 
not by itself form a nerve, but only in combination with conjunc- 
tive tissue and blood-vessels. Some of these compound tissues are 
distributed generally throughout the whole body, others are limited 
to certain parts. To the generally distributed belong conjunctive 
tissue, vascular tissue, and nervous tissue: the other tissues are 
appropriated to determinate parts of the body and have a greater 
self-subsistence, as cartilage tissue, muscular tissue, elastic tissue. 
This was the division formerly adopted by BICHAT. Other di- 
visions of the tissues, founded on chemical research, as into gelati- 
nous and albuminous tissues, may have their use in Physiology, but 
are not to be considered as anatomical divisions. 

The above tissues, then, build up the proximate organic con- 
stituents of the animal body. Formerly, when less weight was 
allowed to microscopic enquiry in general anatomy, the ultimate 
organic constituents in these tissues were neglected : but now their 
description forms a part of the description of the tissues themselves. 
In this way we have learnt to recognise in conjunctive tissue, in 
nerves, in muscles, &c. fibres as the ultimate elements of microscopic 
analysis : in cartilage, round or oblong corpuscles : in corneous and 
adipose tissues, cells. It maybe asked, whether these organic elements 
can be deduced from one another ; or, in other words, whether all the

ANIMAL TISSUES. 17 

tissues proceed originally from homogeneous elements. FONTANA, 
and afterwards TREVIRANUS, busied themselves with this enquiry : 
TREVIEANUS believed that he was borne out in adopting a sameness 
of organic elements in all parts of the animal body, viz. globules 
and thin cylinders (elementary or primitive cylinders) l . According 
to others, these cylinders were by no means primitive, but consisted 
of globules arranged in a row: so that only globules, or round 
vesicles, remained for the elementary particles out of which, in fine, 
all the animal tissues were composed and formed. Subsequent 
enquiries proved, as indeed had been already surmised, that these 
vesicles were due merely to optical illusion 2 . Every one, who in- 
vestigates the tissues with the excellent microscopes of the present 
time, will easily convince himself, that such parts no where exist 
as ultimate elements of organic animal matter. 

Within the last few years, since regard has been paid in the 
investigation of the tissues to their origin and to their development, 
the problem has received quite a different treatment. That the 
tissues consist of different elementary parts, fibres, granules, cells, 
is plain from what has been said above ; but it is another question 
whether these parts did not originally proceed from some common 
fundamental form, of which they are subsequent developments and 
modifications. Much had been already effected by scattered obser- 
vations, but to SCHWANN is the distinction due of having esta- 
blished the original cellular structure of the different tissues, and, at 
the same time, the great similarity between the microscopic stnu> 
ture of Plants and Animals, of which DUTROCHET and KASPAIL 
had already a general notion 3 : our limits do not allow us to pro- 
pound his views, to which the name of Cell-Theory has been given, 
in detail. We will give an outline of them, in a few words, with 
a notice of the modifications which, from later researches, they 
would seem to require. 

The first elements of organic beings are cells. They have their

origin in a formless matter ( Cytoblastema, germ-substance of cells) ; 
what afterwards remains of this substance may be distinguished as 
Intercellular substance (substantia inter cellular is). The cells are 
vesicles, and consist of a fine membrane which encloses a fluid often 
containing granules. For the most part these cells have a so-called 
nucleus, a small dark-coloured corpuscle, lying on the wall of the 
cell. In this nucleus a round spot has been distinguished and 
termed nucleolus. The formation of these cells seems to proceed not 
always in the same manner. According to SCHWANN a nucleolus 
arises first, round this a nucleus is formed as its envelope, by the 
aggregation of granules in the fluid germ-substance : at a slight 
distance from this nucleus there coagulates, as it were, a thin mem- 
brane, the Cell- wall, which at first is raised, like a watch-glass, on 
one side of the nucleus, and afterwards encloses it all round. On 
this account the nucleus is considered to be the germ of the cell 
( Cytoblastus] ; when the cell is formed, the nucleus, according to 
SCHWANN, has discharged its office : it is detached and disappears. 
The researches of HENLE T have shewn that such is not universally 
the case, but that in fibrous tissues formed from cells, the cell- 
nucleus is changed into peculiar fibres. 

Cells when once formed are multiplied by fission, or by the 
formation of new cells within those already formed. The parts 
then of those tissues, with which we have become acquainted 
above, are either cells or fibres which have been formed from cells. 
(1) In some tissues the cells, which have been plainly isolated, are 
present as elements at a later period, as in adipose tissue and 
cuticle ; (2) in other tissues the walls of the cells become thick- 
ened, and coalesce with one another and with the intercellular sub- 
stance, whilst the cavities remain separate, as in cartilage ; (3) in 
others, again, the cavities coalesce, whilst the walls of the cells 
that mutually touch, are destroyed or absorbed. Finally, other 
tissues, still, exhibit as elementary parts little plates without 
cavities, which may probably have existed at an earlier period. 
These either join one another in a plane, or range themselves 
lengthwise in a row, as in the fibres of organic muscles and of 
Conjunctive Tissue. Other fibres may, according to HENLE, be con- 
sidered as compound cells, i.e. those whose nucleus was originally 



1 HENLK, AUr/emrin? Anatomic, s. 188 9. 



THE VITAL FUNCTIONS OF ANIMAL8. 19 

a cell that has become enclosed by a wall or envelope of later forma- 
tion. Muscles, according to SCHWANN, consist at first of nucleated 
cells which range themselves in a row; the nuclei adhere to the wall, 
and within the tube (of the primitive bundle) are formed the proper 
primitive fibres. According to VALENTIN and HENLE, on the other 
hand, the primitive fibres are arranged around the row of cells 
which occupies the middle of the primitive bundle, and the external 
covering of this bundle is a sheath formed afterwards. But these 
and other diverging views we cannot here develope more minutely. 

If once the fundamental truth of SCHWANN' s doctrine be ac- 
cepted, that cells are the original form of animal and vegetable 
tissues, then is it of subordinate importance whether this or that 
view in the case of particular tissues be adopted, and we may sup- 
pose, as, for example, in parts which are formed of plates in which 
there is no distinction of wall and cavity, that the cells have not 
been perfectly formed from the amorphous blastema, but were 
joined together before they possessed a cavity 1 . 

We must here add a word concerning the blood-corpuscles. They 
are flat vesicles, filled with the colouring matter of the blood: 
having in mammalia a round, in birds, reptiles, and most fishes, an 
oval outline. In man, the mean diameter is about ^ millim. In 
reptiles, especially in those without scales, they are larger. In the 
frog, for instance, they have the length of three and the breadth of 
two human blood-corpuscles. Here a nucleus is present, of which the 
existence in mammalia is doubted by some writers. The blood- 
corpuscles, therefore, are cells : and we may consider the fluid, so 
rich in albumen and fibrin, in which they swim and with which, 
during life, they circulate (liquor sanguinis}^ as a liquid intercellular 
substance of the blood-cells. 



The Vital Functions of Animals. 

In order to complete the general idea which we ought to form 
of the animal body, we must not stop at the membranes, but must 
also look at the structure of the principal organs. We unite organs

20 INTRODUCTION. 

and functions in our rapid sketch : and hasten to place before our 
readers a view of the whole. 

The functions performed by animals may be brought into two 
chief classes. One class comprises the vegetative, the other the 
animal functions. The first are so called because they occur 
equally in plants, and are also, on that account, called organic 
functions. The last are peculiar to animals, and therefore are 
called animal functions. 

To the organic functions belong Nutrition in the widest sense, 
and Propagation. To nutrition belong three systems : namely, that 
of Circulation, that of Assimilation, and that of Secretion. Respi- 
ration is a part of the system of secretion : for the object of respi- 
ration, like that of secretion, is the elimination of effete matter, its 
volatilization, or its separation in a more fixed form : and both, in 
this way, support that unceasing interchange of matter by which 
the circle of vital phenomena is characterised. 

By means of these functions, which together are comprehended 
by the name of Nutrition, the life of the individual is secured and 
provided for. Other functions have reference to the life of the 
species, and ensure its existence after the death of the individual. 
These functions constitute Propagation, of which a part are dis- 
charged by the male individual, viz. the secretion of the impreg- 
nating fluid (semen), and its conveyance to germs capable oi 
development. These germs are prepared and protected by the 
female individual, and on the union of these functions depends the 
being of the Embryo, the development of which is the final purpose 
of propagation. 

To the animal functions also belong three systems : viz. the 
nervous system, that of the organs of sense, and that of the organs 
of motion. 

The food, when solid, is comminuted by means of the jaws and 
teeth, or, when fluid, is imbibed. It is then conveyed into the in- 
testinal canal, which ordinarily has an expansion called the stomach. 
Here and at other parts of the intestinal canal different solvent 
fluids are secreted for assisting the conversion of the food. The 
nutrient part of the food is thus separated from the rest and taken 
up by the surface of the inner wall of the canal consisting of 
formative tissue : the remainder is rejected as unfit for the support 
of the creature. 



THE VITAL FUNCTIONS OF ANIMALS. 21 

The tube in which this first process of nutrition is effected, is a 
continuation of the skin. In some very simple animals, where the 
whole body is composed of a homogeneous mass (ex. gr. in Polyps) 
there is properly no special intestinal canal. The body is simply 
excavated, and the internal surface has the same structure as the 
external. Such creatures may be turned inside out, like the finger 
of a glove, without dying in consequence : nutrition can proceed 
undisturbed. Such animals are entirely intestinal canal, independ- 
ently vital stomachs. The external skin also corresponds in func- 
tion with the surface of the canal. The skin has the function of 
Imbibition, which may be compared with absorption by the intesti- 
nal tube : and on the entire internal surface of the intestinal canal 
there is evaporation, which corresponds to that of the skin, and 
with the diminution of this increases. 

In some very simple kinds of animal there is in the intestinal 
canal only a single opening, which allows the food fo enter and 
the refuse to escape. In the rest the two openings are separate. 

The Chyle, or nutrient juice which has been produced by 
digestion, is in many animals immediately poured into the forma- 
tive tissue of the entire body, and so serves for the nutrition of the 
different parts. In others it is mixed with a nutrient fluid of higher 
rank, the blood, which circulates in a system of vessels ; this 
motion is called Circulation. The vessels which carry the blood 
towards the parts are called Arteries : those which carry back the 
blood from the parts towards the center of the circulation are called 
Veins. This motion is ordinarily assisted and regulated by one or 
more muscular organs, called Heart. But the chyle is not sufficient 
to renew the venous blood and render it fit for the nutrition of the 
parts. It must be brought in contact with atmospheric air, and so 
be submitted to change before passing into the arterial stream. 
This function is called Respiration, and the mechanism for it is in 
different creatures so variously contrived, that it is often difficult to 
harmonise such variety with the poverty of our language, accus- 
tomed to include every form under Gills and Lungs. In the case 
of Lungs, the medium that serves for respiration, mostly air, pene- 
trates the cavities whose external surface is bathed with blood. In 
the case of Gills, the medium, here mostly water, does not pene- 
trate within the tissue, but only bathes the surface on which the 
blood-vessels are spread out. Gills have very different forms, as of 



22 IXTKODUCTIOX. 

Plates, Leaves, Threads, Twigs, &c. Many simple and imperfect 
animals breathe by means of the skin. Others, which have either 
no circulation, or none that is perceptible, have Air- Canals, i.e. 
such respiratory organs as convey the air through the entire body 
to the nutrient fluid. 

The nutrient fluid which has thus been separated from the food 
and changed by means of respiration, is now fit for the nutrition 
of the parts. How that nutrition is effected, so that every part 
receives from the common fluid that which is requisite for its 
support, is not known. Here we can only conjecture : and if any 
one chooses to call it a chemical affinity he is at liberty to do so, 
if he merely means that he is contemplating living creatures whose 
organism has a determinate chemical composition, and so does not 
forget that he has given a name to the process, but has not ex- 
plained it. 

Besides the glands which separate from the blood fluids for the 
internal economy, as the Liver, &c., there are others which separate 
constituents that must quit the blood in order that it may become 
more pure, or in order that the due proportion of its constituents 
may be preserved. Thus the kidneys secrete urine, the skin watery 
vapour, &c. Sometimes a secretion is a means of defence, as is the 
case with the Ink of the Cuttle-fish, and with the offensive exhala- 
tions of many animals, which thus repel their enemies or are avoided 
by them. Eightly to estimate all these secretions we must never 
forget that an animal is a whole, and that the secretion of this or 
that fluid, though it may be performed by an individual organ, is 
still under the control of all the other organs, and of life, which 
combines them all. 

Propagation, which also belongs to the vegetative life, has the 
following organs for its instruments : the ovary (ovarium) , by which 
we understand the site and the coverings of the eggs and the eggs 
themselves, conjointly ; the oviduct (oviductus) or the tube, through 
which the eggs, that have been detached from the ovary, pass 
onwards : the uterus, a residence for the eggs during their develop- 
ment, and the vagina along which they pass to leave the body of 
the mother. In the case of two sexes, the male (by means of 
glands named testiculi) secretes the seed (sperma] which fertilizes 
the germs, and effects their development. Penis is the name of the 
part, which, in some animals, conducts the seed into the vagina of 
the female. 



THE VITAL FUNCTIONS OP ANIMALS. 23 

With respect to the animal life a perfect sensation appears to 
be possible only through a Nervous System. This nervous system, 
in the higher, or more perfect animals, consists principally of the 
brain and the spinal cord. The larger the mass of the brain is in 
proportion to the nerves, the more perfect appears to be the develop- 
ment of the intelligence and mental faculties of the animal a law 
that was first discovered by the celebrated SCEMMEEING. In pro- 
portion as we descend to the lower animals, the nervous masses are 
more dispersed and removed from one another, and in the lowest 
families of the animal kingdom no traces of a special nervous 
system remain. 

The Head is that part of the body which includes the brain and 
the chief organs of sense. There are five senses, of which Touch 
(tactus) appears to be the most widely diffused through the whole 
animal kingdom. The seat of touch is the skin, the general 
covering of the body, which is everywhere interwoven with nerves. 
The nerves of the skin are lost, with their little twigs, in its 
middlemost and very dense layer. The ends of the. cuticular nerves 
are covered and protected by the cuticle, and in many places by 
other external insensible parts, as scales, hair, &c. In the organ of 
Taste, the twigs of the nerves of taste pass into the soft papillse of 
the tongue, and end there. The twigs of the Olfactory Nerve are 
spread out upon a mucous membrane (the membrana Schneideriana] : 
the continuation of the medulla of the Optic Nerve forms the Retina, 
which Physiologists determine to be the seat of vision. Lastly, the 
most simple form of the Auditory organ is that of a sac filled with 
fluid, in which there float, as it were, the soft and delicate termina- 
tions of the auditory nerve. From all this it appears, that the 
general form (typus] of an organ of sense is to be sought for in a 
nerve whose terminations form a delicate mass suited to the recep- 
tion of external impressions. But in each particular organ of sense 
the proper nerve of sense is only capable of a determinate action. 
The auditory nerve is only susceptible of sound, or rather, every 
stimulus which affects it is perceived only as sound: the optic 
nerve recognises no other impressions than those of light. Such, 
at least, is the case with man and the higher animals: and one 
organ of sense can never supply the proper office of another. Im- 
pressions are conveyed, by means of the nerves, to the brain or any 
other nervous center. 



24 INTRODUCTION. 

Thus nerves are the messengers by which the mind receives 
information of the external world (nuntii rerum}. 

But the nerves are equally the ministers of the will, which by 
their assistance is able to act upon the muscles. By Muscles are 
understood those active organs of motion (organa motus activa) 
which are fixed to other parts, as their point of resistance, and 
these last are called passive organs of motion (organa motus passiva], 
The harder fibres, which serve for the insertion of muscles, form 
Tendons, of which the colour in animals with red flesh, as in man, 
is white. In many animals the muscles are inserted into the skin, 
or into certain hard portions of the skin, as in Insects, whose hard 
and often horny coverings supply the place of a skeleton in that 
respect. A skeleton is, properly, a connected whole of internal 
passive organs of motion cartilaginous or bony, and these serve 
not only for motion, but moreover, and indeed especially, for the 
protection of the most important parts of the nervous system, the 
Brain and Spinal Cord. The skull (for the protection of the Brain) 
and the Vertebral Column (which encloses the Spinal Cord) must 
therefore be considered as the principal parts of the skeleton, of 
which ribs and limbs are only appendages: in this simple condi- 
tion is the skeleton met with in the Larva, for example, of the 
Frog. 



Development of Animals. 

How ike expression imperfect Animal is to be understood. 

We have attempted to give a general idea of the organs which 
compose the animal body. But these organs are by no means 
found in all animals. Only in the more perfect animals is the 
structure thus complicated. When from these we descend in the 
animal scale, we perceive in the long series one instrument after 
another gradually decrease in magnitude and development, and at 
last entirely disappear. In Polyps (hydras) nothing remains but 
the Intestinal Canal. The entire animal forms a blind sac com- 
posed of a single tissue, and all the vital functions which it 
performs are effected through one and the same gelatinous mass. 
Finally, in some Infusories we no longer perceive even an intestinal 
canal nothing remains but an homogeneous gelatinous body, whose 



DEVELOPMENT OF ANIMALS. 25 

surface appears to discharge the functions of absorption and nu- 
trition. 

A gradual course of development, similar to that observed in 
the animal series, is also pursued by the embryo of the more 
perfect animals. The whole Life is Metamorphosis ; and there are 
animals in which the change of form is so great and so remarkable, 
that it does not escape even the eye of the multitude. Thus, for 
instance, a Caterpillar is changed into a Butterfly : a creeping, dull, 
voracious creature into one that flies and runs, and scarcely takes 
any food. In the same way the metamorphoses of Frogs are 
notorious. But there are other animals whose metamorphoses do 
not occur in so striking a manner, but are principally limited to the 
earliest periods of life. Every animal is slowly developed, and 
becomes more perfect as new organs are added to those already 
present. But this idea must not be so apprehended as if a Mam- 
mal, for instance, had been at first an Infusory, then a Polyp, a 
Medusa, afterwards an Insect, a Fish, a Bird, &c., as some express 
themselves l . This would be as extravagant as it is unfounded : 
but properly, as we conceive, many moderns assume that all the 
organs in different periods of life do pass through a development 
and metamorphosis, and that the structure of a perfect animal, in 
its foetal state, is more simple, and corresponds with that of the 
lower animals of the same Type to which itself belongs. Thus the 
first rudiments of all vertebrate animals are similar, and the history 
of the development of the Chick may illustrate that of Mammals in 
the first periods. This is more than a phrase without proof: rather 
is it the result of very numerous observations for instance, those 
on the Brain and the Heart in the human embryo and we shall 
find it confirmed by frequent instances in the course of the present 
work. 

We have already on various occasions made use of the terms 
' imperfect ' and ' perfect ' animals, and shall have to use them 
often. But since every animal is perfect in its kind, the term 



1 How this gradual progress of the embryo through the different gradations of the 
animal kingdom is to be understood cannot here be further particularized. Compare 
hereon C. F. KIELMEYEB, Ueber die Verhdltnisse der organischen Krdfte unter einander 
in der Reihe der verschiedenen Organisationen. Tubingen, 1814. Svo. s. 38. The differ- 
ent works of CAEUS, TIEDEMANN and J. F. MECKEL supply many examples of the 
application of this position. 



26 INTRODUCTION. 

requires some explanation. By perfect animals we understand those 
that, in the number and importance of their functions, and in the 
complicated structure of their organs, make an approach to Man : 
whilst those are called ' imperfect ' whose simple organisation, and 
less numerous functions, remove them from that perfection of which 
Man supplies the pattern. In this sense, as I conceive, the expres- 
sion may be well defended. ARISTOTLE says that in all other things 
we must proceed just as we do in the investigation of coins, com- 
paring them individually with those which are best known to us : 
but man is necessarily the best known to us of all animals 1 . Let it 
be added, that Man is in fact the center of organisation to which 
the animals, like rays, may be considered to converge and so is the 
union of what is most perfect and most beautiful in them all 2 . 
Hence animals which have a resemblance to man are, not without 
reason, styled perfect. 



On the art of Classifying (Taxinomia). 

Such conceptions become still clearer by unfolding the art of 
Classifying. Classification and systematic division are indispensable 
in Natural History. How innumerable are the species of animals 
which are scattered over the surface of the earth ! Each of these 
species has its country, its determinate form, its peculiar properties. 
How shall we attain to all this knowledge: how shall we turn 
to account the observations of earlier writers, how learn to what 
species they refer ? how can we, in fine, communicate our own 
observations to others, unless we make use of a classification? 
Classifications then are as old as the study of Natural History, and 
their difference is to be sought in their more or less scientific found- 
ation and plan. By means of its systematic arrangement the study 
of Natural History obtains a more extensive influence upon our 
entire scientific cultivation, and in this respect it cannot be suffi- 
ciently recommended to young persons, in order that they may

ON THE ART OF CLASSIFYING. 27 

accustom themselves to strict order in all their other branches of 
study. 

The foundation of all Zoological division is the Species. By this 
is understood the assemblage of all the individuals which have more 
conformity to each other, than to other similar creatures; which, by 
means of mutual impregnation, can generate prolific individuals and 
propagate themselves by generation, so that it can be inferred from 
analogy that they all sprung from a single pair. By specific cha- 
racter is understood the collection of all the characteristics which 
are shewn to be permanent. Those characteristics, on the other 
hand, by which different individuals of a species vary amongst 
themselves, and which are attributable to deviation from species, are 
called varieties. 

The causes of varieties consist in the influence of external cir- 
cumstances, and in the mixture of other similar species. Differences 
from this last cause are called Hybrids. The form is here a com- 
bination of the two parents. 

Such Hybrids appear to be limited, fabulous stories apart, to 
those species which have great mutual resemblance. They are in 
general not prolific not able to continue their race. They occur 
therefore, beyond doubt, in a state of nature extremely rarely, and 
are rather the consequence of the constrained state of servitude in 
which our domestic animals exist. This cause therefore is not of a 
kind to disturb the regular course of nature and to endanger the pre- 
servation of the species. On the other hand, varieties produced by 
the influence of external circumstances, by climate, difference of food 
and mode of life, are able to engender young that are prolific. But 
they do not suggest any doubt that we ought, perchance, to receive 
them for species. It must moreover be remarked, that those varieties 
of ordinary species which on account of the pliancy of their organi- 
sation and their tenaciousness of life are able to live in every climate, 
and appear, for the most part, to have followed man over the entire 
surface of the earth, are the most striking and the most numerous. 

By Genus is understood a second group formed by the union of 
like species, as the species was formed by that of like individuals. 
Species which in general have a striking resemblance in their orga- 
nisation, form a genus. The idea of genus is so natural that we 
meet with traces of it even in the language of children. Still all 
genera are not natural. Many of them have been formed upon some 



28 INTRODUCTION. 

resemblances of species in one or another characteristic arbitrarily 
selected in disregard of the general impression of the external form, 
and in neglect of the precept of the immortal Linnaeus that ' Charac- 
ter does not make Genus 1 .' When a species deviates very much 
from all the others, even from those most resembling it, then a sepa- 
rate genus must be made of it. Hence there are genera which con- 
tain only a single species. The characters of a genus must be 
common to all the species contained in it, and can only be drawn 
from a comparative study of all those species. 

This is the place to say a word concerning the Nomenclature of 
animals. LINNAEUS was the first who gave to every object in 
nature a double name : thus the Lion, for instance, is termed Felis 
Leo, the Dog Cants familiaris. The first of the two names (felis, 
canis) is that of the genus, and therefore common (nomen genericum] 
to all the species which belong to that genus. It must be a noun 
substantive. Different rules have been laid down for the formation 
of names : but to expound them would lead us too far away. Of late 
years, after the example of the Botanists, the names of persons have 
been adopted for the generic name, as Bonellia, Boltenia, Dorthesia, 
Desoria ; but this is much more usual in botany. The second name 
is the specific name, as Leo, familiaris it is either a substantive or 
an adjective, and in the latter case must agree in gender with the 
generic name. By itself it has no meaning, and indicates nothing 
until joined with the generic name 2 . This double name has thus 
an intimate connexion w r ith the Idea of Genus. 

Genera again, after a similar manner, are grouped together and 
formed into Orders, and these again into Classes. We may 
reverse the proposition and say that the Animal Kingdom is first 
divided into Classes, then into Orders and Genera, which last 
contain the Species. 

We have now been taught to recognise the chief divisions. 
An arrangement which teaches us to find with ease the names of 
animals is called a System : which, according to Cuvier's apt com- 
parison, is a dictionary, but with this difference, that here the 



1 "Character non facit genus." 

2 It is the same with the family names and the prsenomens of persons. The first 
indicate a family, the last acquaints us with a particular subject of the family : only 
their order is reversed : i. e. the baptismal name is placed first, and after it the family 
name. 



ON THE ART OF CLASSIFYING. 29 

properties serve us for rinding out the name, whereas in ordinary 
dictionaries the known name serves to acquaint us with the pro- 
perties. That a system may serve its purpose, and supply an easy 
means of finding the name, it must be artificial, i. e. it must be 
taken from a single system of organs and their differences. The 
characters should be easy to find out, and be borrowed from ex- 
ternal parts. An example of such an artificial system is the 
sexual system of Linnaeus. In the animal kingdom we have no 
such artificial system : most of the systems are mixed ; neither 
entirely artificial nor entirely natural. 

For there is yet another kind of systems, called Natural systems 
(Method): of which the chief object is, not so much to find the 
names readily, as to unite in an unconstrained manner those 
natural products which, in the greatest number of respects, corre- 
spond. They are founded, not on a single organ or system of 
organs, but on the whole structure. If an object be seen only on 
one side, on the north or south, east or west, just so many partial 
representations of it will be obtained as there are points of view : 
but he only who observes it in all directions is able to form a 
judgment of its nature and being. This is the advantage of a 
natural method over artificial systems : it does not forget the center 
in the circumference, but comprising all the parts and properties 
of animals in its estimate, it allots to them a place in the arrange- 
ment according to their structure and to the importance which 
belongs to them in the economy of nature, and so combines them 
in a great organic whole 1 . 

A perfectly natural classification has not yet been discovered: 
but we must continue to search after it, and to collect its scattered 
fragments. It is, according to LINNAEUS, the first object and the 
last of the hopes of the Botanist : it ought to be no less so of the 
Zoologist 2 . We please ourselves with the reflexion that we have 
approached nearer to this goal, now that men, especially in our 
century, have begun to investigate the internal structure of animals 
with the same curiosity and the same zeal with which, in the last 
century, after the example of LINNJEUS chiefly, they studied the

external form. Even LINNAEUS himself has declared that a natural 
classification of animals is indicated by their internal structure 1 . 
But if this natural system were quite perfect, it would not merely 
be a register of animals or a large lexicon, but a true image of the 
animal kingdom and a short survey of the entire science. The 
more nearly the science approaches this end, the greater will be its 
perfection. 

We must here, in few words, mention some of the systems 
which have been proposed in Zoology. 

Animals may be divided into Classes in different ways, and the 
differences amongst individual zoological systems are very remark- 
able. AEISTOTLE divided animals into those that have blood 
(fvatpa) and those that have not blood (Zvatpa), and distributed these 
two chief divisions into lesser ones. PLINY founded his division 
upon the different elements in which animals reside, and distin- 
guished these as Terrestrial, Aquatic, and Volatile animals. It 
would carry us too far from our object to enter more fully into 
these and other early attempts at classification. But we must not 
omit to notice the system of LINNJSUS, who threw a new light on 
every department of Natural History 2 . 

In his primary division of animals LINNAEUS was a fol- 
lower of ARISTOTLE: he named however those animals which 
ARISTOTLE called bloodless, white-blooded : whilst of the rest the 
blood is red. The basis of his further division is taken from the 
Circulation of the Blood. Here follows a sketch of his system.

Thus LlNN^EUS adopts six classes, of which the differences, 
though founded on internal structure, have still reference to the 
function of a part which is by no means common to all animals. 
The number of LINNAEUS' Insects and Worms that have no heart 
at all, is in fact at least as great as the number of those in which 
it is present. The so-called Zoophytes, and the Intestinal Worms, 
have no heart : in many animals vessels are already present before 
a heart can be found : insects which undergo metamorphosis have 
only a doubtful rudiment of a heart (the so-called dorsal vessel). 
The physiological importance of the heart is consequently not of 
that kind that it should be considered indispensable in the animal 
economy, as appears to be tacitly assumed in this arrangement. 
Moreover, in Amphibia the heart is provided not with one auricle 
only, but with two, and many of the Worms have not merely a 
ventricle, but also an auricle. Still the first four classes are so 
truly characterised and so firmly founded in nature, that we may 
well wonder that they were not in all times recognised, and not 
earlier formed. That clear and accurate insight which charms 
every one, and that simplicity to which all natter themselves they 
can attain in their own province, are the true characteristics of 
genius. LINNAEUS was less happy in his two last classes, as we 
will shew more particularly. Moreover, it is not commendable 
that the division is founded upon a single organ or system of 
organs, as, for instance, those of circulation. In this way, indeed, 
artificial divisions may be obtained, but not a natural method. 
(See above, p. 29.) 

The arrangement of LINNAEUS, in these last times, has under- 
gone various alterations, when men began, after the example of 
CAMPEK, PALLAS, POLI, and others, to investigate the internal struc- 
ture of animals: in which investigation CuviER 1 , the first anato- 
mist of our age, by his incomparable achievements was especially 



at Leyden in large folio in 1735 : it consists of three tables, each containing one of the 
three kingdoms of nature with some notices appended. He begins with the Mineral 
Kingdom and ends with the Animal Kingdom.

32 INTRODUCTION. 

distinguished. CuviER and LAMARCK at first divided animals 
into two large primary classes : those which have an internal 
skeleton, and those without a skeleton. They called the first, in 
as much as the principal part of the skeleton is the vertebral 
column (see above, p. 24), Vertebrate animals, the last Invertebrate 
animals (Animaux vertebres et animaux sans vertebres}. Vertebrates 
have moreover red blood, whilst the division of Invertebrates have 
either no blood or blood that is white. This fact was known to ARIS- 
TOTLE, who ascribed a spine to all animals that have blood 1 . Having 
made these great divisions, they adopted four classes of vertebrate 
animals, the same as those already established by LINNAEUS, except 
that they called his amphibia Eeptiles, or creeping animals, a worse 
appellation. But the number of classes of invertebrate animals has 
so greatly increased that instead of the two classes, Insects and 
Worms, first five 2 , and afterwards by LAMARCK 3 , twelve classes, 
were adopted. 

It would carry us too far away to discuss particularly all these 
divisions, and the modifications which were introduced into them. 
It is sufficient for our purpose to remark, that attention was now 
no longer directed to one organ, or one system of organs, but 
to the whole organisation. We propose to follow in our work 
CUVIER'S last arrangement with some modifications, but in a 
reversed order : whilst he descends from man to the less perfect 
animals, we, after the example of LAMARCK and others, will begin 
with the least perfect animals, and ascending gradually to the 
more composite, will conclude with man. This course is the 
most advantageous for Physiology. If we would understand the 
physiological value of an organ, we must investigate its gradual 
development. 

CUVIER, in his latest works, has followed a general division of 
the animal kingdom, which takes the place of the two great 
primary classes of Vertebrate and Invertebrate animals 4 . He per-

ceived that the invertebrate division had only negative charac- 
ters: these animals so greatly differ amongst themselves, that in 
order to say any thing precise of their organisation, they must be 
spoken of specially as Soft Animals, Insects, or Zoophytes. He 
adopted, therefore, in the place of the division of invertebrate ani- 
mals three others, and thus divided the whole animal kingdom into 
four large groups, whose characters we here subjoin. 

I. Vertebrate Animals (Animalia vertebrata). The central parts 
of the nervous system, the spinal cord and the brain, in these 
animals lie on the dorsal surface, in a bony or cartilaginous 
cavity formed by the vertebral column, of which the more 
developed anterior portion is called the skull. The limbs, 
when present, are never more than four in number. The 
muscles cover the bones, and are inserted into them. The 
mouth has two jaws placed horizontally. 

II. Molluscs (Animalia mollusca) . The central parts of the ner- 
vous system consist of ganglia, of which usually one, that 
from which the nerves of sense arise, lies above the oeso- 
phagus, whilst the rest are differently distributed on the 
abdominal surface. This nervous system lies in the same 
cavity with the viscera, enclosed by the soft skin into which 
the muscles are inserted. 

III. Articulates (Animalia articulata). The central parts of the 
nervous system consist of ganglia, of which one lies in the 
head above the oesophagus : the rest in a row in the middle 
of the body, on the abdominal surface, and are connected by 
two nervous cords. The covering of the body is divided 
into rings, and has different degrees of hardness : the muscles 
are placed within these rings, and are affixed to them. 
When limbs or feet are present, they are usually six, fre- 
quently more : when the mouth is armed with jaws, they are 
placed sideways, and arranged in pairs. 

IV. Radiates (Animalia radiata). A special nervous system is 

not always present : when found, it appears as a ring, near 
the mouth, surrounding the beginning of the intestine,

edition V. vol. Paris, 1829, 1830). 

VOL. I. 3 



34 INTRODUCTION. 

and from this ring the nerves proceed, like rays, to the 
periphery of the body. The entire body presents a radiant 
form, for the similar parts are not arranged, as in the Articu- 
lates, behind one another in rings, but beside one another in 
a plane. When muscles are present, they are attached to 
the external, sometimes calcareous, covering of the body. 

Let it not be imagined that this modification is insignificant : 
and that the invertebrate animals might very properly be opposed 
to the great .division of vertebrate animals, and be afterwards split 
up into three* sub-divisions. Such symmetrical separations are 
usually deceptive, and can only be of real service when the two 
groups are of equal rank, and are distinguished by positive charac- 
ters. Beyond doub^t, all natural bodies, for instance, are either 
Animals or Non-animals: but who, on that account, would think 
of separating these bodies into an Animal Kingdom, and a Non- 
animal Kingdom? and the Non-animals again into Plants and 
Minerals ? Of like value was, in my opinion, the separation of the 
Animal Kingdom into Vertebrate Animals and Invertebrate Ani- 
mals : the latter division meaning only " other than vertebrate 
animals;" it is an indefinite appendage to a defined group, and 
contains no general idea that can be contrasted with another general 
idea. 

But what is especially to be attended to in these four great 
divisions of the animal kingdom is this : that they are not so much 
distinguished by greater or less perfection of organisation, as by 
general form, and by the manner in which the parts respectively 
are related to one another. A great variety of tissues, of organs 
and of subordinate parts, makes the organisation more complicated 
or perfect ; but that must be distinguished from the general form, 
from the plan of the organisation. CuviER did not overlook this 
truth : and even the name of Fundamental Forms ( Types) , which he 
is careful to use for these four great divisions, indicates the guiding 
idea which led him to adopt them. In each type there is a gradual 
rise and fall of organisation : we descend, says Cuvier, in the type 
of the Molluscs, from the sepia to the oyster, as in that of the verte- 
brates, from man to the fish. But it must not be overlooked, that 
CUVIER did not always sufficiently distinguish the two ideas (the 
Type and the Perfection of organisation), and to this it is to be 
ascribed that his division of radiates comprises many animals which 



ON THE ART OF CLASSIFYING. 35 

are not radiant, but are placed in this type on account of the 
imperfection of their organisation alone. 

It is to YON BAER especially that we are indebted for a clear 
insight into this distinction 1 . He considers the classes as sub- 
divisions of the fundamental form or type, which differ in respect of 
the higher or lower grade of organisation. We may conceive the 
matter differently, thus : that every animal class is determined by 
two factors, of which one is the type of organisation, the other the 
perfectness of structure. The highest perfectness is in general 
linked to the type of the vertebrates : yet how imperfect, how poor 
(if I may use the term) the organisation may be, even in a verte- 
brate animal, the anatomical investigation of ampliioxus lanceolatus 
in recent times has taught us. That this little fish is in complexity 
of organisation far surpassed by many insects and molluscs, cannot, 
on unprejudiced examination, be denied. 

In the arrangement, therefore, of classes, we shall lay down as 
our basis this idea of type of organisation, and shall thus avoid 
separating that which is connected by natural transitions. We 
begin with the Eadiata, because in this type organisation stands on 
the lowest grade, and even the most perfectly organised radiates 
are surpassed by a great, nay the greatest, number of Annulates 
and Molluscs in complexity of organisation, variety of functions, 
and multifarious enjoyment of life. Whether, after these, we pro- 
ceed with the Annulata or the Mollusca, is in a certain sense indif- 
ferent. Nature has not formed the creatures in a single ascending 
rank. Were this the case, then would a single type necessarily 
prevail in them all : yet even in the divisions (classes, orders and 
families) belonging to a single type, we are not able to discover 
such a simple ascent of organisation. The most perfect fish is not, 
by proximate affinity, joined on to the least perfect of the reptiles : 
nor the most composite bird to the most imperfect mammal. It 
was a pleasing dream of the amiable BONNET 2 , that all creatures

form an unbroken chain ; that without any sudden leaps, all hang 
together by insensible transitions. But the breaks in the chain 
have not been filled up by later observation, rather have new and 
previously unrecognised deviations from it been discovered. It is 
not a ladder with uniformly ascending rounds, but rather a net 
which may afford us a conception of the multifarious connexions 
and the various affinities according to which nature has arranged 
her products. 

We have already remarked that the vertebrate animals ascend 
to the highest grade of perfection of organisation : of them, there- 
fore, we may properly consider the different classes last. 

In treating of the Animal Kingdom we shall not make use of 
CUVIER'S distribution of it into four divisions, further than as a 
guiding idea. The Infusories (exclusive of the Rotatories and 
others, which were joined to them on account of their minuteness 
alone) appear to form a distinct group, or at least do not indicate 
the radiating form by which Polyps and others of the lower animals 
are distinguished. We make, therefore, for these simplest animal 
existences a distinct Division, naming them, after the example of 
other authors, Protozoa. Their form is round or oblong, often not 
rigorously determined, but variable during life 1 . 



1 Five great divisions of the animal kingdom might be established, and named: 
Protozoa, Actinozoa, Ectinozoa, Mcdacozoa, Spondylozoa. We are too indifferent to the 
introduction of new names to propose these except in a note. Under Ectinozoa (from 
tttTdvu, extendo) we understand those animals in whose organisation the elongated type 
prevails: they nearly agree with the Articulata. The other names have in part been 
used already, and require no further explanation. 



CLASS I. 
INFUSORIES (INFUSORIA). 1 

THESE animals are called Infasories 2 , because they are to be 
found in infusions of every kind of organic matter, as well vegetable 
as animal. Moreover they live in all stagnant marshy waters, and 
even in running waters, salt and fresh. 

These animals, which on account of their minute size can only 
be discovered, or at all events examined, by means of magnifying 
glasses, were unknown to the ancients. Our LEEUWENHOECK first 
saw them in infusions towards the end of the seventeenth century 
(1675). After LEEUWENHOECK, many species of these animals 
were observed and described in the last century by EOESEL, LEDER- 
MUELLEE, VON GLEICHEN and others : but more especially O. F. 
MUELLER, the Danish naturalist, in a work which appeared after 
his death, figured many species, and gave a systematic arrangement 
of the class. In the present century, EHRENBERG has contributed 
most largely to our knowledge of infusories, and since 1828 has 
from time to time published his investigations in the Transactions 
of the Berlin Academy of Sciences, and more recently has collected 
them into a body in a large illustrated work. 

As the discoveries of astronomers allow us to cast a glance into 
the illimitable extent of space of the universe, so the eye, artificially 
strengthened, affords conviction of the illimitable distribution of

life in the direction of the smallest space. There are infusories 
(monads) having a mean diameter of ~ a&s f a ^ me J which yet 
live so closely together, that the intervening space scarcely exceeds 
their diameter ; a single drop of water measuring a cubic line, if 
only one-fourth of its space were filled with such animals, would 
still contain 500 millions of them. 

This minuteness has misled some authors to designate infusories 
as microscopic animals. We cannot allow to this appellation a 
preference to that of infusories : magnitude ought not to supply the 
character of a class of the animal kingdom, or a ground of division. 
By such an appellation, the union of diminutive species of higher 
classes of animals with infusories, often practised by older authors, 
would be justified. 

In determining what is to be understood by infusories, we must 
look to the whole of their organisation : it requires not many words 
to shew that the investigation of the organisation of creatures so 
minute has difficulties to contend with, which even the best optical 
expedients of our time have only partially removed. For, although 
every species of infusories be not so small as to escape the naked 
eye, yet even these are not bigger than two or three millimeters 1 . 
Of the minute animals that are usually comprehended under the 
term infusories, EHRENBERG'S investigations led him to distinguish 
two classes, which he named Polygastrica and Rotatoria 2 . The 
incontestably greater complexity of structure in the last, the sym- 
metry of their form and their resemblance to the type of the Articu- 
lata, suggested to us, as early as 1834, the propriety of separating 
them entirely from the others a proceeding now approved of by 
almost all zoologists. 

Consequently, we comprise in the class which now occupies us 
only those animals which EHRENBERG calls Polygastrica?. We 
have not, however, adopted that name, for it rests on the opinion 
that the cavities observable in the interior of these animals are 
stomachs, which is doubted by many writers : but even if that were 
admitted, numbers remain in which no such stomachal cavities are 
to be seen. The class, thus limited, contains animals of very simple

INFUSORIES. 39 

structure. Some, in which no oral 1 aperture can be found, must 
receive nutriment by means of absorption through the external 
surface alone. Others have a mouth, usually surrounded by cilia, 
by the motion of which a current is produced in the water, carrying 
the food which it may contain to the mouth. The subsequent 
transmission of nutriment throughout the body is effected in spaces 
of a vesicular form which contract again when their contents have 
been expelled : they are pushed on by others that have more lately 
come into view, and have motions that cannot be reconciled with 
the notion that they possess proper walls. We must rather suppose 
therefore that these vesicular spaces are excavations in the gelatinous 
tissue of the body. The undigested portion of the food is, in many 
of these creatures, cast off by another aperture 2 of the body : in 
others it escapes through the same opening by which it was received. 

Special organs of Respiration have not been recognised. The 
external surface of the body appears to be the seat of that function. 
Still less are there any blood-vessels : perhaps those spaces, which 
in many species are seen to contract and expand, and which are 
various in form and number, may serve for moving and transmitting 
the nutrient fluid which supplies the place of the blood 3 . 

Although no muscular fibres 4 are present, these animals possess 
the power of motion in a great degree. Some move slowly, others 
very nimbly. As organs of motion the greater number have cilia. 
In some are produced by contraction all sorts of changes in the 



1 [STEIN considers all ciliated infusories without a mouth to be larval or embryotic 
forms of other creatures. Die Infusionsth. a. 181.] 

2 [According to STEIN there is no ready-formed anal opening in any infusory. In 
those families which do not reject their excrement by the mouth, it is forcibly pressed 
through the integument of a determinate region of the body, more or less extensive, and 
not sharply defined. After the exclusion, the rupture is completely closed again. It 
is allowable, therefore, to speak of an anal region, not of an anal aperture. Die Infu- 
sionsthiere. p. 24.] 

3 EHRENBERG holds these contractile spaces, or vesicles (?), to be vesiculce seminales. 
The testiculus is with him a structure whose connexion with these vesicles he has not 
demonstrated, and which v. SIEBOLD regards as a nucleus, whilst he compares the 
entire infusory to an organic cell. 

4 In the hollow pedicle of Vorticella, and other similar genera, there is a longitudinal 
muscle which by its contraction effects the spiral retraction of this part. EHRENB. Die 
Infusionsth, s. 270. [CzERMACK denies that the contractile streak in the canal of the 
stem is a muscle : see SIEBOLD and KOLLIKER'S Zeitschrift fur wissenschaftliche Zoolo- 
gie, iv. 442. Also see STEIN, op. cit. p. 81.]

form of the body and of the short digitiform elongations, by means 
of which they move : others again have filiform, branching append- 
ages, that can be drawn in and out. There is no doubt that these 
motions are to be ascribed to an internal power : they have alto- 
gether the character of volition, for the creatures sometimes retard 
their motions, or suddenly stop and again as suddenly swim quickly 
away. Infusories make no distinction of day and night : they are 
incessantly in motion, and no indication of sleep can be detected 1 . 

Coloured (red) spots have been supposed to be eyes, without 
any particular proof: but neither a nervous system nor any distinct 
organ of sense is to be found. 

The multiplication of these animals is by spontaneous fission of 
the body, generally in the direction of the length. In this way 
they can increase incredibly in a short time. In a very few multi- 
plication by buds has also been observed 2 .

[Besides the multiplication of infusories by longitudinal and transverse fission, and 
that by external gems, other modes have been brought to light by the labours of COHN 
and STEIN. They are forms of the encyst ing -process, which STEIN sees reason to believe 
to be common to all true infusories. Colpoda cucullus does not undergo fission, but 
becomes enclosed in a cyst, which in all cases is the secretion of the animal's surface. 
Within this it multiplies by successive division, so that a progeny usually four in 
number, occasionally eight, arises. Each of these is a special cyst, with its own 
external membrane. The original cyst bursts, and the special cysts repeat the same 
process, often several times, until at length the content of each special cyst escapes 
through the ruptured external membrane as young Colpodce. STEIN, op. cit. pp. 15 
25. Tab. in. fig. i 31. 

In Vorticettines (besides the generation by buds or germs, and by longitudinal fission), 
the animal, becoming encysted, is changed into a spherical mass, in which none of the 
original organs can be perceived except the ribbon-shaped nucleus, and a clear space, 
which, however, does not pulsate. Processes are sent through the thin covering at the 
upper exremity, and the form becomes some one of EHRENBERG's.4cwe&5, according to 
the different genera, as Podophrya or Actinophrys. The nucleus, or rather part of it, 
is then transformed into an internal embryo that rotates actively, and closely resembles 
the germ-progeny of a young Vorticelline of the same species. This process is frequently 
repeated in the same Acineta. The progeny may either encyst itself anew, and go 
through the same process, or may at once secrete a pedicle, and become an ordinary 
Vorticelline of the species. 

Such is the process in a young Vorticelline. In a full-grown large one it is different. 
Here the encysted body is transformed into a homogeneous mass, the nucleus falls down 
into a number (more than thirty) of disci-form bodies, which derive nutriment from a 
portion of the liquefied substance of the mother-cyst : another portion of the maternal 



INFUSORIES. 41 

If these animals are not propagated by means of eggs, then 
neither can they have come into being from eggs, and the general 
law that all that lives proceeds from an egg (omne vivum ex ovo) 
does not apply in this case : a wider meaning, then, than the ordi- 
nary one, must be given to the word egg, which denotes a part 
that requires impregnation before it can be developed, and contains 
a yolk with a germ-vesicle surrounded by an external covering. 
To explain the origin of these creatures in infusions, if equivocal 
generation be denied, nothing remains but to suppose that the air 
conveys infusories as it does minute particles of dust, and that the 
organic matter, which served for the infusion, favoured merely as an 
abundant nutriment the multiplication of the creatures 1 . The 
advocates of equivocal generation have not been able to deny the 
possibility of this explanation: and that possibility destroys the 
force of all their proofs and argumentations : especially when it is 
remembered that no space can be so perfectly closed that air cannot 
penetrate it, and that even boiling does not destroy every kind of 
infusory : for their opponents themselves could not absolutely deny 
that infusories were found in boiled infusions which were stopped 2 . 
Indeed the constancy of form in the species, which had been over- 
looked by earlier observers in their experiments, or not understood, 
is irreconcileable with the view that these animal forms are produced 
by external forces as a mere sport of chance : but it is not by any 



substance assumes a gelatinous form in which the embryos swim, and by which they 
are surrounded when the cyst is burst. When this substance has been dissolved in 
the surrounding water they swim freely away, and change the monad form for the 
vorticelline. STEIN, op. cit. pp. 50 64 and p. 146. Tab. in. fig. 32 41. Also vid. COHN, 
Zeitschrift fiir Wiss. Zool. in. s. 260 279. Tab. vn. fig. i 12.] 

1 [It is well known that Infusories are conveyed by the air : EHRENBERG found them 
in the dust borne by the trade- wind : STEIN discovered cysts of Colpoda, of Philodina 
roseola, and of Macrobiotus Hufelandii, on the terminal twigs of beech-trees that grew 
2000 feet above the level of the sea. Philodina roseola is the rotifer which gives the red 
colour to snow. Vid. STEIN, op. cit. p. 25. He quotes EACHENHORST'S assertion that 
if a slip of glass be moistened by the breath, and moved about in the confined space of 
an apartment, infusories maybe seen upon it. SCHMIDT'S Jahr-biicher, 1850, Bd. Lxvm. 
383-] 

3 [The experiments of SCHWANN, POGGENDORFF'S Annalen, Bd. XLI. s. 184, and of 
HELMHOLTZ, MUELLER'S Archiv, 1843, s. 453, have satisfactorily shown that an infusion 
boiled so long as to kill any germs previously existing in it, is never visited by infuso- 
ries if only such atmospheric air be allowed access as has passed through a red-hot tube, 
or sulphuric acid, or caustic potass.]

means necessary to connect such a conception as this with the term 
equivocal generation. As long as it is not pretended by this term 
to afford an explanation, but only to indicate that there are some 
animal and vegetable species that arise not from eggs, but, in a 
way that we are unable to explain, from the decomposition of organic 
matter, so long do we believe that the expression cannot at present 
be dispensed with in Physiology *. The formation of Infusories is 
no primary production of organic matter 2 . Their immediate origin 
from the organic matter of Infusions has never, as we believe, been 
observed at the very instant of its occurrence, and probably never 
will be. Even in the development from the egg we never see the 
forming, but only the thing already formed. In the case of the 
intestinal worms 3 the same obscurity recurs, and the difficulty of 
applying the proposition that all living creatures come from eggs is 
but too obvious from the very constrained and improbable explana- 
tions which have been resorted to. The reason why organisable 
matter assumes those determinate forms that are distinguished as 
genera and species, is altogether unknown : and Physiology is, in 
the same degree, unable to explain how it is that in a complexly 
organised creature developed from cells, in one part muscular fibre 
should arise, in another nerves, and cartilage in another. 

The knowledge which we possess of the geographical distribu- 
tion of Infusories is due to the investigations of EHRENBERG. His 
travels in Asia and in Africa have taught us that in different coun- 
tries different species, nay different genera of these animals are 
found. The species which have the widest geographical distribu- 
tion in the northern hemisphere are Monas termo, Uvella glaucoma,

As to the green matter of PRIESTLEY, in which transformations of infusories are sup-

the exact investigations of later enquirers, of a collection of dead, and in part still living

Paramoecium chrysalis, Colpoda cucullus : the last appears to occur 
everywhere (Cosmopolite). EHRENBERG found Monas termo both 
in stagnant water at the Red Sea, and in spring-water on Mount 
Sinai. Colpoda cucullus is one of the most constant animals in 
artificial Infusions, and was formerly observed by LEEUWENHOECK 
in Infusions of pepper. 



APPENDIX 

TO THE CLASS OF INFUSORIES. 



ON (THE SO-CALLED) SEMINAL ANIMALCULES. 

(Spermatozoa.) 

VON BAER first (1827) introduced the name Spermatozoa (Nov. 
Act. Acad. Cces. Leop. Gar. Vol. xiu) : earlier names, as animalia 
spermatica, Cercaria seminis, &c. have merely an historical value. 

The bodies, for the most part filiform, which have been observed 
in the fecundating fluid of animals of almost every class, have as 
microscopic creatures been ranked with Infusories: other writers 
class them with the Entozoa, a proceeding which can only be justi- 
fied in a degree by the locality where they occur ; while, on the 
other hand, it has introduced several wrong views. An independ- 
ent organisation, in virtue of which they might be considered as 
real animals, has not been discovered. The cause of their motion 
is altogether enigmatical. 

LEEUWENHOECK, the discoverer of the Infusories, was the first 
also who made observations upon these small corpuscles that in 
appearance perform voluntary motion in male spermatic fluid. 
Their discovery is due to a medical student, named HAM, who an- 
nounced them to LEEUWENHOECK in August, 1677 (Phil. Trans. 
1678, No. 142; comp. Letter 113 in the Sevende Verfolg der Brie- 
ven, 1702, p. 65 .. ., or in the Latin edition, Continuatio Arcanorum 
Naturce, Operum Tomo in. p. 60 sqq.). LEEUWENHOECK named 
these bodies animals, and observed them consecutively in different 



44 SPERMATOZOA. 

species of various classes of animals. It was his opinion that they 
formed the embryo, and that the female's share in the work of pro- 
pagation was simply the reception and nutrition of the male pro- 
duct. This view of LEEUWENHOECK'S as to the office of sperma- 
tozoa in propagation was afterwards entirely rejected : until, in our 
own century, DUMAS maintained that they form in animals the 
foundation of the nervous system (the brain and spinal cord) : to 
which view he was led by a certain resemblance of the first rudi- 
ment of the embryo (the so-called primitive streak) to a spermato- 
zoon (Diet. Glassique d'Histoire naturelle, T. vn. 1825. p. 221, 
article Generation, Annales des Sc. nat. xn. 1827. p. 443-454). 
But it is not founded on observation, and is moreover sufficiently 
refuted by the fact that some animals have spermatozoa closely 
resembling those of mammals, whilst their nervous system has a 
totally different form from theirs. 

According to WAGNER'S investigations, these active molecules are 
formed in cells, singly or in bundles : from which, on bursting of 
the cell-wall, they are set free. In insects they are found as fine 
threads without a head, or thicker portion: but in most other 
creatures they consist of a thicker part, the head, and a very fine 
thread, or tail. The head is, in different animals, of a different 



[The spermatozoon of the Batrachia has an extremely fine mem- 
brane attached to its tail in the direction of its axis and throughout 
its whole length by one of the sides, the other being free and wavy. 
Thus a delicate undulating border is formed. It was discovered by 
AMICI and rightly described by him, and afterwards by POULET. By 
others it was mistaken for a thread surrounding the tail with a loose 
spiral coil. Vid. J. N. CZERMAK, Zeitsch. f. wissensch. zool. B. n. 
350-355, also VON SIEBOLD, ibid. pp. 356-364.]

EHBENBERG says, whole volumes might be filled, are not noticed by us 
that we may not incur a diffuseness unsuitable to the limits of this manual.

the most important discoveries of the author and of other contemporary 
observers. [This work has been translated into English by Dr Willis.

SYSTEMATIC 
AREANGEMENT OF INFUSORIES. 



CLASS I. 
INFUSORIA. 

MICROSCOPIC animalcules, often of mutable form, without 
nervous system and vessels, mostly with internal globose cavities, 
moving by means of vibratile cilia, or exsertile processes, without 
true articulated feet. 

From a definition all that is uncertain and hypothetical must be 
excluded as far as possible. Hence we do not call the internal cavities, 
which are seen in most Infusories, stomachs. Our class, limited 
as above, contains several of the Polypes gelatinaux of CUVIER, 
and agrees with the Polygastrica of EHRENBERG. Many genera, as 
JBacillcvria, Navicula, Closterium, are omitted, because it is highly 
probable that they belong, as many writers have admitted, to the 
vegetable kingdom. 

ORDER I. Simplicissima. 

Naked, extremely minute, external organs none, form persistent. 
Family I. Vibrionidce. Body filiform.

ORDER II. RMzopoda DUJARD. (Pseudopoda EHRENB. in part). 

Animalcules with mutable form, moving by means of multiform 
exsertile processes, without vibratile cilia or other external organs. 



46 CLAvSS I. 

Family II. Amcebcea. Animalcules naked, emitting and retract- 
ing irregular, mutable lobes by continuous motion. 
Amoeba EHRENB. (Proteus MUELL.) 

Sp. Amoeba diffluens EHRENB., Volvox Chaos L., Proteus diffluens MUELL. ; 
ROESEL, Ins. m. Tab. ci. fig. A T ; x MUELL., In/us. Tab. n. fig. i . . . 12 ; 
EHRENB., Infusionsih. Tab. vin. fig. xii. A gelatinous mass, of rounded 
form, if the entire animal contracts itself on disturbance of the water ; 
when the water becomes quite at rest the body extends itself variously 
into lobes and processes, which are drawn in again. ROESEL observed 
these parts to be even torn asunder by extension, so that there arose two 
animals (Propagation by spontaneous division). The name Proteus had 
been previously given (by LAURENTI) to a genus of Reptiles, and was on 
that account changed into Amiba 2 by BORY, and into Amoeba by EHREN- 
BERG. [Perhaps Amoeba is a temporary state of other forms, as of the 
shelled Rhizopods, &c. Vid. LIEBERKUEHN, in MUELLER'S Archiv. 1854, 
s. 17, and COHN in SIEBOLD and KOELLIKER'S, Zeitschf. Wissensckaft. Zool. 
Bd. iv. s. 262.] 

Family III. Arcellina. Animalcules enclosed in a membranous 
lorica or calcareous test, partly exsertile from their covering, and 
emitting processes sometimes filiform and branched. 

They are small calcareous forms (shells) divided into cells, found 
in sea-sand and in a fossil state in the Chalk-formation, and espe- 
cially in the coarse tertiary limestone. These miscroscopic crea- 
tures occur in incredible numbers, 6000 of them having been 
counted in an ounce of sand from the Adriatic sea, whilst an 
ounce from the shore of the Antilles contains, by computation, near 
four millions. They were investigated at the end of the last cen- 
tury by SOLDANI, and in the present by FICHTEL and MOLL, and 
afterwards especially by D'OnBiGNY, who defined more than 1600 
species of them. Until within a few years these bodies were refer- 
red to the Molluscous Division, genus Nautilus L. (Cephalopoda, 
vid. the first edition of this Manual, n. pp. 107, 108). Recent 
observations, however, consign these Polythalamia or Cellulacea to 
a much lower position, near the genus Proteus of Mueller. Although 
D'ORBIGNY has been satisfied by the investigations of DUJARDIN 
that these animals do not belong to the Molluscs, he still believes 
that they ought to be considered as a distinct class of the animal 
kingdom (standing between the Polyps and Echinoderms), and 
calls them Foraminifera, the same name under which he formerly 



1 BORY DE ST VINCENT and DUJARDIN refer these figures to another species, sup- 
posed to differ from Proteus diffluens by its greater size.

INFUSORIA. 47 

described them as Molluscs. From the end of the last cell of the 
shell by one or more openings, or from numerous pores on the sur- 
face of the shell, thin contractile threads are extended which serve 
for motion. [On dissolving the calcareous matter from the shell of 
living species, there always remains an organic base of the exact 
form of the shell with all its pores and passages. This is a secre- 
tion effected by the contained animal mass. ScHULTZE 1 .] EHREN- 
BERG thinks that these animals are allied to the Bryozoa (the so- 
called Polyps of Flustra, &c.) ; his principal reasons against their 
arrangement in the class of the Infusories are, that they have no 
polygastric intestinal canal, and that there is no other instance of 
calcareous shells amongst Infusories.

podophrya be under examination. STEIN thinks there is no specific difference between 
the two, certainly no generic. From his observations it appears, indeed, that both 
Actinophrys and Podophrya are Acinetce forms derived from encysted Vorticella micro- 
stoma. Die Infusionsthiere, p. 138, &c.]

in particular genera of Infusories much variety of opinion exists, and that the point 
is not easy to determine will be obvious to every one who observes for himself. This

Family XIII. Vorticellina ( Vorticellina and Ophrydina EHRENB.) 
Body campanulate or infundibuliform, with large vibratile cilia at 
the margin of the aperture. Mouth and anus approximate, situated 
in a pit of the margin. 

Formerly these animals were classed amongst the Polyps as Bell- 
Polyps, Bastard-Polyps, &c. (See the first Dutch edition of this 
Handbook, i. p. 66.) It was believed that the infundibular or bell- 
shaped body is the csecal stomach, and the large opening the 
mouth. The true oral aperture, however, is placed on the e dge of 
the hollowed body. The food describes a circle in the parenchyme 
(according to EHRENBERG in a special intestinal canal l with several 
lateral dilatations) and is again ejected near the oral aperture (hence 
the names cycloccela and anopisthia given by EHRENBERG). The 
analogy with the molluscan type, even if an intestinal canal be not 
admitted, cannot be overlooked, and probably these animals will be 
ranked by future writers, as imperfect forms, with the Bryozoa. 

The cilia on the edge of the bell-shaped body cause in the water 
an eddy which hurries onwards minute corpucles whether dead or 
alive, and conveys them towards the cavity. If some early and 
also later observers (amongst others even AGARDH, Nov. Act. Acad. 
Ccesar. Leop. Carol. Natur. Curiosor. x. 1821, pp. 127 137, Tab. VIL 
ii.) have seen in this a power of fascination, the fact must be ascribed 
to the circumstance, that they did not notice the cilia.

of plant, and have described and figured it under the name of Ulva pruni-

the Vorticellines with the Bryozoa and Molluscs (compound Ascidice)

f 1 The stem of spirally flexible Vorticellines consists of a wall and an internal 
canal containing a thread, or streak, which does not exactly fill it. When a stem or 
branch divides, the structure of the divided parts is not exactly the same in Carchesium 
and Zoothamnium. In CarcJiesium the canal and streak of a branch have no connexion 
with the corresponding parts of the stem on which it stands. After each fission 
one only of the fission-progeny occupies the apex of the already existing stem, and 
continues to prolong it by secretion of new matter, the canal and the thread suffering 
no breach of continuity. The other individual secretes at first a short portion of stem 
which is quite solid, and is in connexion with the outer wall only of the stem pre- 
viously existing. It is after this commencement that a new canal and a new streak 
begin to be seen. The same occurs at every subsequent division : the individual at 
the apex has the canal and streak of its stem in continuity with the similar parts

CLASS II. 
POLYPS. (POLYPI) 1 . 

POLYPS are gelatinous, oblong or conical animals with a con- 
tractile body, an intestinal cavity and an oral aperture, which is 
surrounded by a circlet of arms or tentacles. 

Besides these arms there are no special organs of sense, at least 
in the greater number of Polyps, though all appear to be very sensi- 
ble of the stimulus of light. Propagation is effected partly by eggs, 
partly by germs or buds : in many instances the last are not de- 
tached from the parent stem, and thus there arise compound animals, 
different individuals being connected. 

Our Polyps were, for the most part, unknown to the ancients : 
and under this name entirely unknown. By it they understood 
naked molluscs of the form of sepia, especially that genus which 
is now called Octopus 2 by Zoologists. From analogy, and from 
some resemblance of form, REAUMUR and JUSSIEU first gave the

POLYPS. 61 

name Polyp to those fresh-water animals that had been described 
by TREMBLEY, and which are provided with a circlet of arms. 

To this class belong many marine animals, which at first sight 
rather resemble plants than animals. Formerly these so-called 
Sea-Plants were, on account of the hardness of the calcareous sub- 
stance of which they consist, referred to the mineral kingdom : and 
Corals were compared to branching crystallisations (Arbor Diance) 
and stalactites. Hence the name (Lithophyta, Lithodendra) stone- 
plants. The ancients believed that Corals were soft whilst in the 
sea, and only became hard in air : 

Nunc quoque curaliis eadem natura remansit, 
Duritiem tacto capiant ut ab acre, quodque 
Vimen in cequore erat, fiat supra cequora saxum. 

OVID, Met. iv. 750 752. 

Even amongst later authors traces may be found of the same 
opinion, founded on defective observation, or on confusion of soft 
species with similar hard ones. Up to the middle of the last cen- 
tury, it was the prevailing view that these Corals belonged to the 
vegetable kingdom. MARSIGLI, in 1706, observed on the shore of 
the Mediterranean some of these products (Alcyonium, Corattium, 
Antipathes) , and found in their pores little bodies that contracted 
when the stem was removed from the water. Such bodies or buds 
he took to be flowers, and so believed that at length the view was 
definitively established which consigned these marine products to 
the vegetable kingdom. But still the animal odour, that was ob- 
served, opposed this view, as well as the chemical investigations 
of GEOFFROY, of LEMERY, and of MARSIGLI himself, which demon- 
strated ammoniacal constituents in these supposed sea-plants, just 
as in animal substances. PEYSONNEL, a physician of Marseilles, 
observed at that place (1723) the Blood-Coral, and afterwards on 
the coast of Northern Africa examined different Madrepores and 
Millepores : the result was that he found MARSIGLI' s Plants to be 
Animals, and named them Orties Corallines. He imparted his dis- 
covery to REAUMUR: to whom the notion seemed so improbable, 
that in a short notice of it which he gave in the Memoires of the 
Academy of Sciences at Paris 1727, he felt bound to suppress the 
discoverer's name. Shortly afterwards, when PEYSONNEL'S dis- 
covery had been forgotten, TREMBLEY found in our country the 
fresh-water Polyp, and communicated his observations to REAUMUR, 



62 CLASS II. 

In the two following years BERNARD DE JUSSIEU, the celebrated 
Botanist, investigated Alcyonium (Lobularia), Flustra and Tubu- 
laria on the coast of Normandy, and confirmed PEYSONNEL'S dis- 
covery: whilst REAUMUR also adopted his views. LINNAEUS, 
accordingly, transferred the Corals and stone-plants to the animal 
kingdom : and thus more than half a century was required to 
effect the adoption by Science, as a firm truth, of that view which 
FERRANTE IMPERATO had announced at the beginning of the 
16th century 1 . ELLIS, PALLAS, CAVOLINI and other authors, 
in the latter half of the past century, extended and multiplied our 
acquaintance with these interesting marine animals, of which the 
investigation still affords to S9avants of the present day a rich 
material for new and important discoveries. 

Polyps are either naked, or are provided with a body more or 
less hard, which they surround like a bark, or by which they are 
surrounded. To the naked Polyps belong the well-known Armed 
Polyp of fresh-water (Hydra L., Polype d'eau douce, h bras en forme de 
cornes). The body of this animal is hollow within, and terminates 
in a little cylindrical stalk that is without any opening. There is 
a single row of tentacles round the mouth which can be extended 
like long rays, or be contracted into little conical swellings. 
These tentacles are not all formed at once, but at different times : 
their number is therefore indeterminate, and frequently varies in the 
same species. Generally there are not more than six tentacles 
present : rarely more than twelve. By their assistance the fresh- 
water Polyp can creep along upon water-plants or upon the bottom, 
overpower its prey, and convey it to the mouth. These Polyps are 
very voracious, and feed upon minute Crustaceans ( Cypris, Daphnia, 
Monoculus, &c.), and upon worms (Stylaria paludosa LAM. Na'iSj 
TuMfex, &c.), which frequently surpass them in bulk. Accordingly

their mouth admits of much expansion : and the body can be dis- 
tended. The food is moved to and fro in the cavity of the body, 
and in a short time (often within a quarter of an hour) is .converted 
into a pap. The undigested residue is rejected through the mouth. 
Propagation is effected usually by buds. A minute swelling rises 
on the surface of the Polyp; it grows, loses its conical form, be- 
comes tubular, acquires tentacles, and is then a new Polyp. The 
young animal continues to sit on the body of the parent, and thus 
receives the same nutrition in common. Upon this young one 
other young buds may be developed. Thus a branching arises. 
At length the young Polyp separates itself from the parent stem 
(in summer frequently after four days, in winter later), assumes an 
independent state, and new buds are formed, or those already 
present are multiplied. 

Thus these Polyps may form compound animals. Many indi- 
viduals of the same species are united so as to make up a single 
body. All the animals thus combined gain their nutrition in com- 
mon, have a common life. It is not the animal kingdom only 
that affords us instances of compound living bodies : the vegetable 
kingdom presents many such 1 . By an individual, in the vegetable 
and animal kingdoms, may be understood a body that cannot be 
divided into two or more similar portions, without the idea of a whole 
being lost, and whose vital functions pass through a determinate 
cycle of periods 2 . The development of the fruit is the final function 
in vegetable life: when this is accomplished the plant may die. 
Many plants bear fruit only once whether in one year, or in two 
or more years ; such plants die after fructifying, and are true indi- 
viduals. There are other plants again, which leave a determinate 
portion after the fructification, that continues to live, and, after a 
time, bears fruit anew. The portion that thus remains may con- 
sist of root alone, or of root and stem. Such plants are, in reality, 
compound. 

A tree therefore is not an individual, not a single plant. The 
buds of the tree are new plants : they are developed, grow, possess 
an independent life, which is 'passed in determinate stages. Hence

old trees may afford an emblem of perennial youth : every spring 
they are covered again with leaves as fresh as those they had fifty 
years before. The stem alone is old, the leaves are still yoimg 
again. 

We might be able, from the branching of the fresh-water Polyps 
from their living stem, to explain the plant-like forms of Corals 
and other such marine products. When a Polyp does not consist 
of a single soft mass, but contains a harder substance, or is sur- 
rounded by a calcareous sheath, then from the union of many such 
a body may arise which resists decomposition, and as such after the 
death of the Polyps, may be preserved in our collections for a 
length of time, as for ages they have been preserved in the cal- 
careous strata of our mountains, formed at the bottom of the sea in 
a former epoch of the world. This common mass is named a Poly- 
pary or Polypstock (Polyparium} *. After the Polyps had been dis- 
covered, these stone-plants, as they had been called, were supposed 
to be the work of the animals that dwelt in them, and were com- 
pared to the cells of bees. This view of the matter does not now 
require confutation. That of LAMARCK and others agrees more 
closely with the true nature of the process ; they consider the 
polypary to be a secretion upon the surface of the Polyps, and com- 
pare it with the shells of Molluscs (Snail or Mussel-shell). As 
there are Snails both naked and with shells, in like manner there 
are Polyps that are naked, and that are shut up in tubes : and the 
Polypstock is the union of the shells caused by the connexion of 
the Polyps that lived in them. Thus the Polypary would be, on 
this view, a dead substance, deposited in layers like a mussel-shell. 
Though this be nearer the truth than the earlier idea according 
to which the Polyps built their houses, still it does not entirely 
accord with the true nature of the process. Observation proves 
that this part, at least in many species, has a proper life, that it is 
nourished, grows, and is the seat of that gemmation whence new

le nom de plantes et que pour leur en imposer un qui exprimdt exactement ce qu'ils sont, on 
devoit les appetter des polypiers?" Mem. pour servir a VHist. des Insectcs. Tom. vi.

POLYPS. 65 

Polyps have their being. It is a covering which, like a dermal 
skeleton 1 , may become horny or calcareous. 

The hard, stone-like Polypstocks which form coral-banks, are 
particularly deserving of notice. But the part they play in altering 
the earth's surface has been much exaggerated by FORSTER, PERON, 
and other voyagers. The numerous coral islands of the southern 
Pacific having an annular form with banks steep on the outside 
and shelving gently down to the trough or the included water, are 
clearly of volcanic origin. They are covered with Corals, but do 
not consist of Corals. Polyps cannot live at great depths, but the 
Corals rest on shallows or on mountain-ridges in the sea, similar to 
the rocks parallel to the coast of the Red Sea. Hence Corals may 
contribute to the formation of islands, or may prevent the washing 
away of the shores of islands already formed, just as plants that 
grow on sandy coasts protect the hillocks from being blown away 2 . 

After these general remarks on Polyps and Polypstocks, we must 
dwell for a little on the particulars of structure of the different 
animals that belong to this class. It would be a defective and 
erroneous idea, to suppose that TREMBLE Y'S fresh-water Polyps are 
to be considered as the Type of the class. That we drew the atten- 
tion of our readers, in the first instance, to the fresh-water Polyp, is 
merely to be attributed to the historic form which, in introducing 
this class, we thought useful for the right understanding of it. The 
animals which live in Polyparies have in several respects a much

piers, Ann. des Sc. Natur, Seconde Se'rie, Tom. x. 1838. Zoologie, pp. 321 334. 

LAMARCK appears to me in some degree to contradict himself, when in one place he 
calls the polypary a common body possessing an independent life, and producing new 
individuals upon its surface, which die and are again replaced by new ones, and con- 
tinuing its life almost unobserved as long as it is surrounded by water alone (Hist. Nat. 
des Anim. sans Vert. I. p. 63, new edition) ; and in another place denies to the poly- 
pary all life, and compares it with the shells of molluscs, ibid. II. pp. 86 99. Before 
this, LINN.&US, PALLAS and others had recognised in the polypary a proper life, but of 
late years this opinion, on the authority of LAMARCK, has been almost generally 
relinquished.

nearer alliance to Sea-Anemonie-s (Actinia?}, which CHAMISSO and 
EISENHARDT had properly classed with Polyps 1 , although CUVIER 
joined them to the Medusae (Aoalepkcs), LAMARCK and SCHWEIGGER 
to the Star-fishes (Echinodermata) . These Actinice have a tubular 
form, or resemble truncated cones. By their discoidal base they 
adhere to rocks, marine shells, and other bodies ; but are able to 
loosen their hold, and to consign themselves to the motions of the 
water. They can also creep by means of that base, as the belly- 
footed molluscs ( Gasteropoda] do by means of their ventral disc. 
But ordinarily the motions of these animals are restricted to a 
greater or less expansion of the oral aperture, and to a contraction 
of the hollow tentacles which surround the mouth in a variable 
number, but always greater than twelve. These Actiniae are naked 
Polyps, rather of a coriaceous than a gelatinous consistence ; they 
were not unknown to the ancients, and are noticed by ARISTOTLE 2 
as Acalephce, and by PLINY 3 as Urticce. Such Polyps with Polyp- 
stocks are the genera Fungia, Caryophylla, Astroea, Mceandrina. 
The Polyps of other Polyparies, as Isis, Alcyonium (Lobularia), 
Tubipora, &c. have eight tentacles, which are flat and notched on 
the edges or have lateral prolongations. In all these the intestinal 
canal is a blind sac. But there are other Polyps which, by their 
more perfect organisation, approach the Molluscs. Their intestinal 
canal is reflected upwards, and terminates by an opening close to 
the mouth. AUDOUIN and MILNE EDWARDS observed this struc- 
ture (1828) in Polyps of the genus Flustra*: at the same time 
EHRENBERG published his earlier observations to the same effect, 
and gave to Polyps, with this organisation, the name of Bryozoa; 
which has been received into the systematic works of zoologists 5 ,

and is now commonly used. MILNE EDWARDS makes a separate 
class of these creatures, and places it amongst the Molluscs, after 
the naked Acephala, or Tunicata. Their arms are beset with cilia, 
which however are also remarked in some other Polyps, and conse- 
quently are not a distinctive character of Bryozoa, as would seem 
to be implied by the name Ciliobrachiata. To these Bryozoa belong 
the genera Alcyonella, Eschar a, and Flustra. The remaining 
Polyps we shall name, with EHRENBERG, Anthozoa. 

The simple stomach of the Anthozoa is, for the most part, sepa- 
rated from the cavity of the body. In Actinia this space is divided 
into many prismatic cells by partitions that stretch perpendicularly 
from the outer surface of the stomach to the innermost surface of 
the covering of the body. Similar partitions are found in many 
Anthozoa^ though in much smaller number. One or more openings 
conduct from the bottom of the stomach to the cavity of the body, 
or to the general common cavity of the Polypstock 1 . In Hydra 
there is no special cavity of the body, but the cavity of the stomach 
is in immediate connexion with the walls of the body. It was 
formerly erroneously believed that the stomach of this animal is 
simply an excavation of its body, and that the structure of both 
surfaces is the same. The internal surface is coated with conical 
cells whose points are directed inwards 2 . The external surface, on 
the contrary, is formed of flat cells, and contains oval vesicles, from 
which a long delicate thread can be projected, (Angel-organ of the 
Germans 2 ). TREMBLEY, amongst his many experiments on the 
reproductive power of the fresh-water Polyp, even turned the body 
inside out, like the reversed finger of a glove. Nevertheless, the 
creature continued to live, and took food. This may be explained 
by a change of structure, the consequence of the violence of the 
experiment. In Bryozoa, the intestinal canal is freely suspended in 
the cavity of the body: a longer or shorter oesophagus leads to a 
muscular stomach, lined, in some cases, with horny teeth, closely

cilia on the arms of Flustra. Edinb. New Philos. Journ. ill. pp. 107 337.

set in rhomboidal rows : then comes a second stomach ending below 
in a blind sac that is continued at the upper part into an intestine, 
which ascends by the side of the stomach and oesophagus, and 
near the mouth, or a little below it, terminates in the anus. 
Brown follicles cover the external wall of the stomach, and seem to 
represent the liver 1 . In some Polyps a circulating system has 
been observed, or at least vessels, which probably arise as branches 
from the intestinal tube, anastomose with one another in the Polyp- 
stock, and effect a communication between the different individuals 2 . 
In many, moreover, a stream of water is found, which penetrates 
by the mouth into the canals of the Polypary. It has been observed 
that the flow is caused by cilia on the walls of the canals. Probably 
this motion is in connexion with the function of Respiration. 
LISTER saw in the stem of Plumularia pluma LAM. the stream in 
the same canal moving alternately in opposite directions 3 . 

We have seen above that propagation in Polyps is usually 
effected by buds. In Hydra, after being developed, they are sepa- 
rated: in others they remain attached to the parent-stem. But 
besides this mode of propagation, a sexual generation has been 
observed in this class. In Hydra, about winter-time, a periodical 
development of eggs on the inferior part of the body has been ob- 
served. The thin membrane, surrounding the egg as it projects 
from the body, bursts, and the egg attaches itself to some object or 
other in the water. In some species the yolk-membrane is covered 
with cloven ramiform processes, as if with spines. After two or 
three months the young one is visible. The conical excrescences 
which arise higher up on the body at the base of the arms, and 
which are perforated at the point, contain spermatozoa ; and may, to 
a certain extent, be considered to be external testes 4 . These genital

organs may exist at the same time, and in variable number, in one 
and the same individual. And many other Polyps are also herma- 
phrodite. In others again the sexes are separate : whether both male 
and female individuals occur on one and the same stem (Moncecia, 
as in Plants), or one Polypstock bears only males, another only 
females (Dicecia). The last is the case of Veretillum. In the 
Bryozoa, Monoscia appears to prevail universally, yet so that (to 
judge from the investigations of NORDMANN in Tendra zostericola, 
and of VAN BENEDEN in Alcyonella) the cells which contain Polyps 
with eggs are more numerous than those with spermatozoa. These 
peculiar constituents of the seed (vid. above, p. 43), of which the 
motions are so striking under the microscope, have, of late years, 
caused the important discovery of the sexual propagation of Polyps ; 
but for them, ovaries alone would now, as twenty years ago, be 
ascribed to this class, especially as the seed-secreting organs (testes) 
are not to be distinguished in it, as to external appearance, from 
those that prepare the germs (ovaria) 1 . In those Anthozoa that 
have, like the Actinia?, a cavity of the body distinct from that of 
the stomach, they are situated between or upon the partitions that 
divide that cavity into cells (see above, p. 67). In Sertularia and 
Campanularia most of the Polyps are without sex, whilst cells with 
ova are developed in the axillae of the branches. 

Propagation by spontaneous division does not occur in most 
Polyps. In Caryophylla there is a complete longitudinal fission, 
occasioning the dichotomous form of the Polypary, since two Polyps 
come from one, four from two, &c. If the longitudinal fission be 
incomplete, cells of irregular form arise, as in Mceandrma. 

In most Polyps the power of reproduction is very great. TREM- 
BLEY'S experiments on the fresh-water Polyp are well known : he 
divided them longitudinally and transversely, and every piece 
formed a new animal 2 . ROESEL found that even the tentacles or 



1 Such is the case also in Mollusca, nay even in some fishes ; and in general the 
sexual organs in the animal kingdom possess a similarity in the two sexes, which was 
observed by the ancients, and occasioned many fanciful appellations and comparisons. 

2 Hence LINN^US borrowed the name Hydra for this animal genus, from a com- 
parison with the Hydra of mythology :

Ducit opes animumque ferro.

70 CLASS II. 

arms, when separated, grew into new Polyps ; an experiment which 
did not succeed with TREMBLEY. The power of reproduction is 
in Actiniae just as great ; they regenerate parts that have been cut 
away, and admit of propagation by artificial division, as DICQUEMARE 
especially has shewn by his experiments. 

Before leaving the propagation of Polyps, we must notice those 
late observations which indicate so close an affinity between Medusae, 
and certain Polyps, that in time probably a great revolution will 
be made in the systematic arrangement of the animal kingdom. 
In Syncoryne, for instance, and Coryne (Clava), and certain Cam- 
panularice bell-shaped appendages or off-shoots have been noticed, 
which at length are separated from the stem, and resemble minute 
Medusse. Conversely, also, the observations of SARS and of VON 
SIEBOLD have shewn that Medusae come from the egg under an 
oblong form resembling that of infusories beset with cilia: these 
move freely, at first, then fix themselves, lose their cilia, become 
clavate, acquire arms, and perfectly resemble Hydra. These hydra- 
like forms divide by transverse indentations, and separate into rings 
from which Medusce arise. 

It is possible, therefore, that all hydra-form Polyps may be only 
imperfect forms of Medusce. And if so, those animals which 
RE'AUMUR first named Polyps, would no longer belong to this class. 
But on this supposition it is wonderful that Spermatozoa should be 
observed in Hydra and Coryne : a fact that may cause us to hesitate 
before we conclude, with DUJARDIN, that the eggs, described above 
(p. 68), are Bulbilli. At all events the perfect form of Hydra would 
then be unknown 1 .

POLYPS. 71 

Of the nervous system of Polyps little is known ; it has not 
been described as a connected whole, but different observers have 
imagined that they had discovered ganglia or a nervous ring near 
the mouth. From analogy it is probable that the nervous system, 
where it exists, does form a ring round the mouth ; and that the 
threads, which SPIX described in the pedal disc of Actinice as 
nerves, can on this account scarcely be considered to be such. As 
organs of sense, four coloured spots at the edge of the disc have 
been observed in the Medusa-form products of Syncoryne and Coryne 
fritillaria of STEENSTRUP, which entirely resemble the parts that 
EHRENBERG considers to be eyes in Medusa. Still more distinct is 
this organ in a form described by QUATREFAGES, which he names 
Eleutheria dichotoma. Here this author found six eyes with a 
hemispherical lens, a granular pigment of a red colour, and a 
spherical projection of the integument closing the eye like a comea 1 . 

In Bryozoa the muscular system is most largely developed, and 
serves principally to retract the animal within its cell. It protrudes 
itself partly by straightening the alimentary canal, partly by means 
of transverse muscular fibres which contract the diameter of the 
visceral cavity, and in that way elongate it 2 . Traces of a muscular 
system have also been met with in other Polyps. 

As to the geographic distribution of Polyps, we have only 
imperfect notices. Fresh-water Polyps, Hydra, Alcyonella, Plu- 
matella, have, as far as I know, only been observed in Europe ; but 
from this to conclude that they do not occur in tropical regions, 
would probably be premature. Still EHRENBERG found no Hydros 
in Africa and Arabia. Actinice are met with in all seas. The 
Polyps with polyparies, which are almost all inhabitants of the sea, 
are richest in species in warm regions ; Flustra, amongst the 
Bryozoa, is it seems an exception to this : the European species of 
this genus are about as numerous as the foreign : these last come 
principally from New Holland; Gorgonia occurs in all seas, but

nearly one-half of the numerous species is found in America. Of 
swimming polyparies (Pennatulce) , many species are found in the

Umbellaria of Greenland, which attains a length of six feet, is 
remarkable. Of the stony polyparies, the greater number occur in 
the seas of hot countries, as ex. gr. Madrepora, especially Astrcea, 
Caryophylla, Fungia, Mceandrina. Most of the species of the last 
genus are found in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific. The Red 
Sea also has very many species from the division of these stony 
polyparies. More than one-fourth of the known species of this 
class were found there by EHRENBERGK Notwithstanding the 
proximity, it seems that the Red Sea, with the exception of some 
species of Actinia, has no species in common with the Mediterranean. 
Isis nobilis (Corallium rubrum) appears to occur in the Mediter- 
ranean alone. 

Of many genera numerous fossil species are found, especially of 
those whose species now live in hot regions. Thus the genus 
Astrxa numbers more fossil than living species : and these petrified 
remains belong principally to the Jura- and chalk-formations. Still 
more numerous are the fossil species, as compared with those now 
living, in the genus Turbinolia. A genus which appears to connect 
Fungia and Turbinolia, Cyathophyllum of GOLDFUSS, has quite died 
out, and occurs in transition limestone. In the same way fossil 
species alone are found of the genera Ceriopora, Favositis, Pustu- 
lopora, Heteropora, Catinipora and Aulopora. The fossil Polyparies 
prove, like all other remains of an earlier vegetable and animal 
world, that the surface of our earth had in earlier times a higher 
mean temperature than it has now. 



SYSTEMATIC 
ARBANGEMENT OF POLYPS. 



CLASS II. 
POLYPI. 

ANIMALS contractile, having an intestinal cavity, with distinct 
terminal mouth, surrounded by tentacles or radiating lobes, seldom 
free, oftener affixed, aquatic; usually secreting a hard calcareous 
or horny body (polypary), and adhering to it. 

Propagation is by eggs, gems, stolons. Usually compound ani- 
mals are formed of many individuals cohering. 

SECTION I. Anthozoa EHRENB. 

Aperture of the nutrient canal single. Tentacles contractile, 
mostly without vibratile cilia. 

ORDER I. Hydriformia. 

Tentacles of variable number. Nutrient canal excavated in the 
parenchyme of the body, not surrounded by an abdominal cavity. 

Family I. Hydrina. Naked, free, spontaneously affixed, with 
deciduous progeny. 

Hydra L. Body cylindrical, narrowed into a pedicle, simple or 
ramose from the progeny not having been detached. Mouth 
crowned with tentacles, round, contractile, in a single whorl.

at pp. 67, 69. 

On this genus compare the work of TREMBLEY, noted in p. 60, and of 
LAURENT, p. 68. The first discoverer of the genus was LEEUWENHOECK, who 
probably observed Hydra grisea. He announced this animal in a letter to 
the Royal Society of London, of Dec. 25, 1702, observed its propagation 
by gemmation, figuring it with two young ones, and especially described 
the great contractility of the arms. Phil. Trans. No. 283. Vol. XXIII. for 
the years 1702, 1703, pp. 1304 1311. This description, however, had 
been forgotten when TREMBLEY discovered the animal a second time. 

Clava GMEL. Coryne of authors, not of GAERTN. Body cla- 
vate. Tentacles scattered. 

These animals are marine, and adhere to different bodies. Propa- 
gation is effected by buds of a round or bell-shaped form, which 
contain ova or spermatozoa, and which occasionally detach them- 
selves from the stem on which they were developed, swim freely 
about, and resemble small Medusae.

he formed the genus Pedicellaria.

made up of stolons, connecting tubes erect, ventricose, striated, each 
containing a Polyp. Whether the Polyps are retractile or not, does 
not appear. Comp. genus Evagora PHILIPPI (p. 79). 

Family IV. Halcyonina. Polypary fleshy, spongy, perforated 
by many canals, and crowded with microscopic calcareous spicula. 
The Polyps associated in the polypary, retractile, witli tentacles 
pinnate. 

This family has its name from the genus Alcyonium L. called in 
Holland Zeeschuim or Zeekurk (sea-foam or sea-cork). Under the 
genus Alcyonium of LINNAEUS were comprised species which, like 
Alcyonium SCHLOSSERI, belong to the Molluscs (Ascidice), as SA- 
VIGNY has shewn ; other species are Bryozoa (Alcyon. gelatinosum). 
The genus Alcyonium of LAMARCK contains plant-like forms without 
polyps. To these spongy plants belongs also the genus Alcyonellum 
QUOY (Euplectella OWEN). Consequently there remain for this 
family those species alone which LAMARCK has united under the 
genus Lobularia, and probably it would be well, according to the 
suggestion of SCHWEIGGER, to reject the name Alcyonium altogether, 
for the sake of avoiding confusion.

Polyps scattered. 

The separate polyps are entirely retractile within the common 
body, formed by the union or concretion of the external covering 
of the polyps. This is thick and spongy, and contains a great 
quantity of small irregular crystals of carbonate of lime. Propaga- 
tion is by eggs and buds (gemmce). The form and size may be very 
different in one and the same species, so that the distinction of 
some of the species proposed by authors is uncertain.

that these polypstocks swim about in the sea, appears to be un-

the fishermen's nets have broken the Pennatula loose, that it swims

1 Scirparia or Scirpearia Cuv. is said to be distinguished by Polyps placed alternate 
on the two sides. This genus is founded on Pennatula mirabilis, Polypus mirabilis 
LINN. Mus. Adolpk. Frederici Regis, Holmiae, 1754. Fol. Tab. xix. fig. 4. p. 96. It 
is very possible that LINNAEUS afterwards mistook a foreign species (from China, see 
Amosnit. Acad. iv. p. 257) for one from the North Sea (Fauna Suecica, p. 543, "habi- 
tat in oceano Norvegico"), and this last may be Virgularia mirabilis. To me the genus 
Scirparia appears very doubtful. The type which served for LINNAEUS' description, 
was not known at Stockholm, as my friend Prof. SUNDEVALL wrote to me (4 July, 
1846).

Family VI. Tubiporina. Polypary calcareous, of parallel 
tubes, close set, conjoined by transverse partitions. Polyps tubular, 
the neck retractile, soft, the lower part indurated, forming the poly- 
pary. Tentacles in single or double row at the margin, retractile by 
involution.

(the Polypary) ; for this animal and its organisation compare especially the 
beautiful plate in FREYCINET, Voyage de VUranie, Zool. PI. 88. The 
Organ-Coral consists of cylindrical, hollow tubes, standing perpendicular 
with transverse partitions. These last arise from a horizontal expansion, 
which at the top of the tube surrounds its circumference radially. The 
expansions connect the tubes together, and become partitions when the 
tubes above them begin to grow. From this elongation of the tubes 
their jointed form arises, and when the growth ceases, they form a new 
transverse expansion round the wall of their aperture. EHRENBERG has 
distinguished the species of this genus more accurately : they are usually 
comprised under the collective name of Tubipora musica. The Polypary in 
all the species is purple-red ; in the Indian species which PERON ( Voyage 
aux terres Australes I. p. 146), and QUOY and GAIMARD ( Voyage de VUranie, 
Zoologie, pp. 634 641 and PI. 88) observed, the Polyps are green, in others 
they are whitish or light red, as in those which CHAMISSO described (Nov. 
Act. Acad. Leop. Carol. N. C. Tom. x. p. 370, Tab. xxxm. fig. 2), and in 
Tubipora rubeola QUOY (Voyage de V Astrolabe, Zool. iv. pp. 357 359), 
GUE'RIN Iconographie, ZoopJi. PI. xxn. fig. i, where the fin-like indents 
at the edge of the tentacula stand in a single row, as in Tubip. Hempricliii 
EHRENB., whilst in Tubipora musica EHRENB. to which FREYCINET'S plate 
quoted above refers, they form a double row. 

To Tubipora fossil Polyparies appear to belong, Catenipora (escharoides) 
and Syringopora GOLDF. from the oldest limestone (mountain-lime). 

Family VII. C&rticata. Polypary fixed, ramose, its bark soft, 
supplied with calcareous spicula or granules, polypiferous, its axis 
hardish stony or horny. Polyps retractile, with tentacles having 
a single row of small conical appendages at the margin, gemmi- 
parous and oviparous, conjoined by canals creeping through the 
bark. 

The barked-corals (corticiferes) of LAMARCK form a division very 
nearly allied to Alcyonium and Pennatulina. The polypary is here 
in rts origin and mode of structure very different from that of the 
Tubiporina, but on the other hand resembles that of the Penna- 
tulina. The hard axis, which alone is usually preserved in collec- 
tions, may be compared with that of the Pennatulina ; they are, in 
a word, fixed Pennatulina.

is exported to the East Indies, and is also much used in Europe for neck- 
ornaments. It grows on all sorts of marine bodies, even on other corals, 
and not only downwards, but in all directions, increasing very slowly ; it is 
seldom more than a foot long. The streaks visible on the unpolished axis 
are the impressions of vessels which run in the bark, and form a communi-

branches upwards ; the latter are usually situated in a plane, and 
often coalesce. Many earlier and later writers have believed the 
stem to be a plant, on which Polyps had fixed themselves. (De

by closer investigation be better denned. LAMOUROUX and EHREN- 
BERG have formed different genera, which by the last especially have 
been distinguished by the arrangement of the Polyps.

gelatinous, deciduous. 

Sea-shrub. The bark which is gelatinous, not calcareous or 
fibrous, is missing in specimens taken from the sea : hence, when 
preserved in collections, they resemble branches of dead wood. 

EHRENBERG thinks Antipathes ought not to be joined to Gorgonia, 
and that it probably belongs to the Bryozoa. He refers to later 
communications, which have not yet, as far as I know, been pub- 
lished. (Die Corallenthiere des rothen Meeres, s. 113 in a note.) 
MILNE EDWARDS does not hold this opinion, LAMARCK Hist. nat. 
des Ani. s. v. n. p. 684. According to GRAY the Polyps of Anti- 
patJieSj which he investigated in a specimen referred by him to 
Ant. dichotoma PALL, have six arms, but, with the exception of 
this strange anomaly, agree with those of Gorgonia. Proceedings of

new genus Manicina. The singularly flat and thin leaves of this Polypary 
have given occasion to the name of Endive-Coral {lactuca}.

B. Polyps secreting internally a hard body (Polypary stony,

Family XI. Fungina EHRENB. 

The stony polypary is here an internal induration of the animal, 
and is by EHRENBEKG compared with the calcareous plate of Cephalo- 
pods (the back-bone of the Sepia). 

Fungina LAM. Polypary free, orbiculate or oblong, hemi- 
spherical or conical, above convex and lamellose, with an oblong 
central lacuna or gap, below concave and rugged. Star single, 
occupying the upper surface with lamellse denticulate or rough on 
the margin. 

Sea-mushroom. The numerous plates, running from the center to 
the circumference, give this Polypary some resemblance to a mush- 
room, in which however the plates are situated beneath the cap. 
Some have an elongated form, and hence, in the names they bear, are 
compared to moles or slugs. 

The Fungice lie in clefts of rocks and cavities of coral-reefs, 
surrounded by branched corals, so that the force of the current is 
broken whilst the access of sea-water is not precluded. The older 
specimens are quite free : but younger ones are seated on a stem, 
on rocks, or sometimes are fixed to the dead remains of other 
Fungice ; in the pedunculate state they resemble the genus Garyo- 
phyllia LAM. The stem is at first hollow, and is afterwards filled 
with calcareous coral-substance ; the disc becomes larger, and at 
last the stem entirely disappears. S. STUTCHBUEY, An Account of 
the Mode of Growth of Young Corals of the genus Fungia, Trans- 
act, of the Linnean Society of London, vol. xvi. 3. p. 493 498. 
1833. 



88 CLASS II. 

In most the entire Polypary belongs to a single Polyp. In some 
species no tentacles or arms are distinguishable ; but in others there 
are numerous thick, conical arms, irregularly scattered; in the 
middle the large, transverse oral aperture is seen. The animal 
surrounds the Polypary as well beneath as above. See the figure 
of Fungia crassitentaculata QUOY and GAIMARD, Voyage de V Astro- 
labe, Zooph. PI. xiv. f. 3, 4, also transferred into the illustrated 
edition of CUVIER, R. Ani. Zoophytes, PL LXXXII. fig. 1. GUERIN, 
Iconogr. Zoophytes, PL xxiu. fig. 6. In other species, according to 
the observations of ESCHSCHOLTZ, QUOY and GAIMARD and others, 
many animals are grown together ; the oral apertures, here without 
tentacles, lie partly in the oblong median depression of the Polypary, 
partly between the plates. These form the genus Polyphyllia QUOY 
and GAIMARD, and Herpolitha ESCHSCH. (Ilerpetolitha LEUCK.), 
Haliglossa HEMPR. and EHRENB.

an animal much resembling an Actinia, with a large oval oral-aperture 
surrounded by numerous, very large, transparent tuberculated rays. The 
other species upon which LAMAKCK has founded this genus are only known 
in the fossil state. It was thought that they were not affixed, and con- 
sequently they were referred to this family ; the discovery, however, of the 
voyagers quoted above, shews that the species now living far rather belongs 
to the family of the Ocellina, and probably ought to be joined to Mono- 
myces EHRENB. It may be suspected, perhaps, from STUTCHBURY'S 
observations, that here younger forms of Fungia have crept in. 

To Turbinalia the genus Diploctenium GOLDFUSS, Flabellwn LESSON 
may be added. See FldbeUum pavoninum LESS. Illustrations de Zool.

malium ab H. MERTENSIO in orbis terrar. circumnavigatione observa-

The Anemonies live on Crustacea, conchifera &c., swallow even 
occasionally large mussels, reject the shell, when the fleshy part has 
been extracted and consumed, by the mouth, and evert for this 
purpose their body, which they do likewise whenever they feel 
hunger. Their reproductive rJbwer is almost as great as that of 
Hydra ; if they be divided transversely, new tentacles after a few 
weeks are seen on the inferior portion, and each half becomes a 
perfect creature ; thus they may be propagated by fission, but 
propagation by spontaneous fission does not appear to occur 
naturally amongst Actinice: usually it is effected by ova which get 
into the stomach from the ovaries and are there developed ; when 
the young ones come out of the egg they are rejected by the mouth. 
That the actiniae are viviparous was formerly observed by BASTER. 
The young have at first fewer arms or tentacles than are after- 
wards present. 

These animals, with their coronet of tentacles, resemble com- 
pound or double flowers ; at the same time many also attract by 
their lively colours. Most of them are very sensitive of the 
stimulus of light, and the brighter the day spread their tentacles 
the more. Of A ctinea depressa RAPP observed that it immediately 
contracted when sun-light fell upon it. 



POLYPI. 91 

The cylindrical body is formed of a thick skin of which the 
innermost layer consists of longitudinal and transverse muscles. 
The tentacles are hollow. The stomach is a folded blind sac. The 
space between the stomach and the skin is divided by numerous 
partitions j the ovaries, whose efferent canals open into the base of 
the stomach, lie in the chambers thus formed 1 . 

Actinice are marine animals; they occur in the temperate and 
torrid zones. Some species are brought to market by the Italians 
and are eaten.

These remarkable animals, discovered by QUATREFAGES, live on the sea- 
shore in the sand, like Sipunculus and some Annulata. The tentacles are 
not perforate at the extremity, as little as they are so in Actinia, in which 
preceding authors (RAPP, RYMER JONES and others) admit a reception of 
water through the presumed apertures. 

ORDER IV. Bryozoa. 

Nutrient canal supplied with double aperture (mouth and anus), 
replicate, the posterior portion ascending by the side of the anterior. 
Tentacles long, furnished with vibratile cilia, surrounding the 
mouth. The anterior part of the polyp soft, retractile within the 
posterior by inversion. 

EHRENBERG was the first to separate with precision these animals 
from the other forms of the Polyps see the Introduction to this 
class. MILNE EDWARDS makes of them, in company with the 
Acephala nuda, a division of the type of the Mollusca under the 
name of Molluscoides. As in our first order of Polyps we see a 
resemblance to Acalephce or Medusae, in the second recognise the 
proper type of the Polyps, 'and in the third perceive a transition to 



POLYPI. 93 

the Echinodermata, so in this last order we cannot mistake the 
affinity to the Mollusca; this affinity is even so close that we hold 
the union of it with the Molluscs to be almost the more natural 
one.

RASPAIL is of opinion that this animal is merely a form of Plumatella 
campanulata altered by age, from which he does not distinguish Plumat. 
cristata j as soon as the animal breaks the egg, it moves freely about, and 
should then be described as Cristatella, so that all of them belong to one and 
the same species at different periods of life. But amongst other objections 
to the union with Plumatella cristata and campanulata is the number of 
the tentacles which in Alcyonella is, according to RASPAIL, only forty-four 
(according to EHRENBERG forty-two), whilst here, if it were an older state 
of Plumatella campanulata, the number might rather be expected to be 
greater. Also in Cristatella there are more tentacles. However, it is 
possible that Cristatella may be .a younger form of another species of 
Plumatella, and so at some future time to be excluded from the list of 
genera. 

PALLAS, as it seems, first discovered the Alcyonella in our country in the 
well-known lake of Rockanje, in the island Voorn, and described it by the 
name of Tubularia fungosa, Nov. Commentar. Acad. Scient. Petropol. xii. 
1768. The name Alcyonella should be rejected, for it was borrowed from 
a supposed resemblance with Alcyonium, which on further investigation 
was found to be totally unfounded.

and female individuals occurring in the same Polypary. Bullet: de I' Acad.

CLASS III. 
SEA-NETTLES (A CA LEPHJE) \ 

BY Sea-nettles are understood radiate animals of a gelatinous, 
transparent substance, which swim freely, and of which the organisa- 
tion in parts that are frequently repeated usually indicates the number 
four or its double. They "have no intestinal canal, but ordinarily a 
blind stomach from which numerous tubes, mostly divided into 
branches, run like rays to the circumference of the body (aquiferous 
vessels, respiratory organs?). In some the sexes are separate: 
others appear to be bi-sexual. Traces of a nervous system are 
present at least in some; yet organs of sense, except appendages 
which serve for feeling, are absent in many, whilst some have in 
addition parts which by certain writers are considered to be organs 
of hearing, by others organs of sight. 

Of the name Sea-nettles, Acalephce, Urticce marince, we have 
treated above. With LAMARCK they form an order of the class of 
radiate animals (Badiaires) , under which this writer also groups

those with a spiny skin (Echinodermata) as a second order 1 . They 
were first described as a distinct class of animals by CUVIER in the 
first edition of the Eegne Animal, under the name of Acalepha? 2 . 

The name of gelatinous animals is more appropriate to this class 
than to some others of the Kadiates of CUVIER. The kinds most 
generally known bear the name of Zeekwallen in Holland, [Quallen 
in Germany, Squalders 3 or sea-jelly or sea-blubber in England.] 
When thrown by the sea upon the strand, they lie motionless 
during the ebb ; for they do not creep, but can only move in the 
water by contraction and expansion. 

The pungent and burning pain like that caused by stinging 
nettles, which many species inflict on being touched, was generally 
considered in former times to be the effect of a mucus secreted by 
the skin of these creatures. It is only since 1841, from WAGNER'S 
microscopic investigations, that minute threads situated on the 
surface of the skin have been recognised as connected with this 
phenomenon, since in Acalephes which cause no such pain (as in 
Casswpea) they were not discovered. Each of these threads lies 
rolled up in a little oval vesicle or cell, from which, on pressure or 
irritation of the skin, it is forced out by eversion ; they are readily 
detached with the vesicle to which they are fixed by a tubercle, 
and are always present in the secreted mucus that produces a burn- 
ing pain. Yet the cause of this ought not to be considered as 
entirely mechanical ; it is probable that some acrid fluid, secreted 
by the cells, adheres to the threads 4 . Nevertheless an accomplished

des Anim. s. vert. 1815. 

2 CUVIER in his Tableau e"lementaire (1798) and in the tables at the end of the first 
part of his Lecons d'Anat. c'omp. had comprised all the animals, which he afterwards 
named radiated animals, in a single class, under the name of Zoophytes. Of this the 
Orties de Mer make the second order, which agrees with his later class of the Acalephce. 
Here also he placed the Actiniae, which however in the second edition of his Eegne 
Animal he separated from it again, in order to unite them, as had already been done 
by others, with the Polyps.

observer, Dr F. WILL, found these threads in Eucharis (amongst 
the Beroecea) without perceiving any irritation on touching it. 

In many there is only a single oral aperture, placed in the center 
on the inferior surface of the body. In others many suctorial tentacles 
are seen, or the arms have apertures conducting to tubes, which, 
like vessels, fall into larger stems and finally open into a common 
cavity, the stomach (Rhizostoma Cuv.). From the stomach arise 
water-canals, which are provided internally with cilia. By some 
writers these have been regarded as blood-vessels : but far rather 
ought they to be considered as respiratory organs, since in part they 
open freely on the surface of the body. But, in addition, blood- 
vessels have been found, which, at least in Beroe 1 , lie round about 
the water-canals, surrounding them like a sheath. Here nucleated 
corpuscles have been observed (blood-corpuscles'?) which however 
move only very slowly and irregularly. 

The sexual organs are distinct in the disciform Acalephes, but 
have in both sexes the same form. In ^Equorea they lie in form of 
folded plates on each side of the water-canals which spring from the 
stomach, towards the inferior surface of the disc. In the eared 
Medusa (Aurelia or Medusa aurita) there are four cavities, opening 
below at the disc and which have been taken for respiratory cavi- 
ties, in which lies a folded organ, that is, an ovary or a testis, 
according as it contains ova or spermatozoa ; in most Acalephes the 
spermatozoa have the ordinary cercarial form. In other Acalephes, 
as Beroe, ovaries and testes are united in the same individual: 
here they lie along what are called the ribs, beneath the skin. 

The metamorphoses, of which we have already spoken above, 
are remarkable in young Medusce. The eggs, that pass from the 
ovaries along the canal of the arms to their folds, are collected here 
and carried about, for a time, by the mother in saccules which 
afterwards disappear 2 . The young animals quit these receptacles 
in the form of ciliated Infusories resembling Leucophrys or Bursaria. 
These swim freely about, but after a short time (two or three days 
according to SIEBOLD) become fixed by their thicker anterior ex- 
tremity which has a sucker. Next, the body becomes cylindrical, 
transparent, and at the free end, which thickens, an oral aperture is

seen, round which at first two, then other two projections appear 
that become lengthened out into arms. Soon there grow out four 
other similar arms, and the animal has then the form of an eight- 
armed Polyp. These arms can shorten and lengthen themselves 
greatly. In this state the animal continues several months, and 
can multiply itself by buds and offsets. Subsequently there come 
into view transverse indentations, by which the animal is divided 
into several rings resting upon one another, round each of which 
eight rays arise. These rings are like young medusae piled on one 
another : they become separated from each other, from before back- 
ward ; and then swim freely away as young medusae 1 . How long a 
period is requisite for their full growth is unknown. The genital 
organs could not be distinguished until they were more than an 
inch in size. Hence it is clearly an error when some ascribe to 
these creatures in general a very short duration of life and a rapid 
growth or even name them annual animals. Their power of re- 
production seems to be very small. Some species are able to bear 
the loss of parts, but these when removed do not continue to grow. 
In the genus Cestum, however, MERTENS was led to believe, from 
some observations which he was unable to complete, that propaga- 
tion by spontaneous division may be admitted. [And this has been 
lately confirmed by KOELLIKER 2 , in Stomobraohium mirabile, which 
he believes to be a larval form ofMesonema ccerulescens, a new species 
of Medusa discovered by him at Messina. The fission begins in the 
stomach many individuals having been found with their round 
disc somewhat elongated and with two stomachs more or less com- 
pletely separate by constriction, but still lying side by side. Next, 
a meridional groove is seen on the outside of the disc between the 
stomachs : it deepens gradually until the acaleph is separated into 
two distinct individuals. The whole process may be completed in 
eight to twelve hours. The multiplication however is not yet

finished: the halves again divide in a direction perpendicular to 
the former line of division : but here the fission does not always 
begin in the stomach. How often the process may be repeated is 
not known. No trace of fission was observed in Mesonema, though 
it was often seen to occur in the larval forms, even when ova were 
already distinctly visible on the vessels.] 

[The Siphonophorm have been shewn, by the investigations of 
HUXLEY, LEUCKART, KOELLIKER, GEGENBAUER and VOGT, to be 
compound animals, or colonies, connecting the hydroid polyps with 
the acalephs. They are named by KOELLIKER, in consequence, 
Swimming Polyps (polypi nechalei). They consist in general of a 
stem, usually cylindrical and long (Diphyes), sometimes shortened 
and sacciform (Physalia), sometimes disciform (Velella), to which 
appendages are attached which differ remarkably in form and func- 
tion. Some of these are suctorial tubes or stomachs, others motive 
organs, others feelers and prehensile organs, others again protective 
laminae (bracts) and sexual capsules. Great differences prevail with 
respect to the number, arrangement, and development of these parts, 
in the different families : those which are constant in all siphono- 
phors are the stomachs, the prehensile apparatus, and the sexual 
capsules. The stem is muscular, and hollow the interior forming a 
canal in which the nutrient fluid moves with rapidity. The swim- 
ming apparatus is either passive or active when passive it is a 
hydrostatic apparatus consisting of a bladder filled with air which is 
always placed at the upper extremity of the common stem : when 
active it consists of swimming-bells, which are also placed at the 
upper extremity of the stem, and are variously grouped, and in 
variable number in different genera : the swimming-bells may exist 
conjointly with the air-sac or without it. These bells are, in 
general, formed on the plan of a Medusa, consisting of an elastic 
bell-shaped mantle, very various in form, with an internal mus- 
cular- layer which surrounds the swimming-sac. On the outer sur- 
face of the latter, there is a system of four radiating vessels, which, 
at the circumference of the aperture, fall into a circular vessel, and 
at the summit of the bell arise from a single vessel, which passes 
through the pedicle of the bell and falls into the cavity of the com- 
mon stem. All the other appendages of the stem have also a more 
or less perfect system of vessels, which communicate with the inter- 
nal cavity of the stem in a similar way. The only communications 



SEA-NETTLES. 103 

from without with the cavity of the stem are by the mouths of 
the digestive tubes, which answer to the bodies of polyps. The 
food digested by these stomachal polyps is conveyed from their 
extremity into the cavity of the stem, from whence it is carried 
through the vessels of all the appendages, partly by the contractility 
of the walls of the stem, partly by the action of the cilia which 
line the vessels of the appendages. 

The polyps, or suctorial tubes, or stomachs, have no tentacles 
round the mouth. They consist of three portions; the external, 
very variable in form, the proboscis and mouth : the middle swollen 
portion, the digestive stomach, with dark streaks containing bile- 
cells : the terminal rounded portion, with thick cellular walls. At 
the base of the stomach, or sometimes immediately on the common 
stem, is the prehensile apparatus for the capture of prey. This 
usually consists, for each polyp, of a single long and thin thread 
with lateral subdivisions, which do not branch ; more rarely of sim- 
ple threads or shorter cylinders. This apparatus is always supplied 
with multitudes of thread-cells, which in the case of lateral acces- 
sories are grouped in very regular and constant forms, and are con- 
spicuous from their bright yellow colour. The sexual appendages 
have large swimming bells of the general medusan form. They 
consist of a bell-shaped mantle and vessels and a nucleus, more or 
less conspicuous, which contains in its substance the sexual ele- 
ments, and is dependent from the vertex like the clapper of a bell. 
In some cases the medusan form of the mantle is in great measure 
suppressed, whilst in others it is quite complete, and here the sexual 
appendage is detached at an early period, as in certain hydroid 
polyps, and the sexual elements are developed afterwards : where 
the medusan form is not thus perfect, the contents of the sexual 
capsules, when detached, are found to be mature. The Diphyidce 
are, according to LEUCKART, all uni-sexual, but the observations 
of GEGENBAUER (Zeitschr. f. wissensch. Zool. v. p. 313) shew that 
some at least have the organs of different sexes on different groups 
of the same stem : the Physophoridce are all bi-sexual, in some 
(Stephanomia) the organs of the two sexes being on different pedi- 
cles, in others (Physalia) on the same pedicle. 

The organs of less general occurrence are the Bracts, Laminae 
or Covers, and the Feelers. The Bracts or Covers, more solid 
than the other organs, are for their protection : they contribute little 



104 CLASS III. 

to the motion of the colony, but sway gently to and fro with the 
contractions of the stem. The Feelers are cylindrical or vermiform 
structures having much resemblance to the polyps, but without an 
external opening. In some cases they are in constant motion, 
feeling about in all directions : in others they are more sluggish 
and are loaded with the general nutrient fluid. The latter fact 
would seem to suggest a respiratory function. Some writers have 
considered them to be receptacles for the fluid forced from the 
interior of the prehensile apparatus during its violent contractions : 
and hence the name, sometimes given to them, of fluid-holders. 
But it has been objected to this explanation, that the two sets of 
organs are often at great distances from each other, and that their 
alternate action has not been established. 

The composition of all the organs in the Siphonophors cor- 
responds to that of the other acalephs. As in these, the specific 
gravity of the mass differs little from that of sea-water. The shell 
found in some families, (velella, porpita] is the thickened and hard- 
ened wall of the air-sac 1 .] 

On the Nervous System of Acalephs, the observations are 
hitherto imperfect. In the Medusae EHRENBERG observed, at the 
base of each of the eight marginal corpuscles which he takes to be 
eyes, a part which he considers to be a ganglion. Each of these 
ganglia is double, or consists of two limbs that diverge towards the 
marginal corpuscle. Besides these a row of ganglia lies near the 
tentacles at the margin of the disc ; every ganglion divides into two 
twigs, each of them for one of two adjoining tentacles: so that 
every tentacle receives two nervous twigs coming from different 
ganglia. This ring of ganglia round the margin is interrupted by 
the larger double ganglia of the marginal corpuscles. Moreover, 
EHRENBERG saw four groups of ganglia lying in the cavities for 
the four genital organs and in connexion with the tentacles of these 
cavities. EHRENBERG could not detect a nervous ring round the 
mouth, the usual form of the nervous system in Eaclials 2 . Some 
writers are of opinion that it by no means follows from these obser- 
vations that the parts so described are really nerves. GRANT de- 
scribed in Cydippe pileus a nervous ring with eight ganglia, each

giving off three nerves, of which the largest ran lengthwise between 
two bands of cilia 1 close to the external surface of the body; but a 
later observer, F. WILL, was not so fortunate as to find this system 
of nerves. On the contrary he detected a conical ganglion above 
the funnel-shaped structure from whence the water-canals arise, 
consequently opposite to the mouth. From this ganglion many 
fine threads arise, to be distributed to the substance of the body 
and its different parts. In the same situation MILNE EDWARDS also 
saw a ganglion in the genus Lesueuria, from which numerous 
nerves, collected into four bundles, arose 2 . 

EHRENBERG considers the eight prominent organs, situated in 
Medusas, at the edge of the disc, to be eyes : they contain a sandy 
or stony concrement, a quantity of minute hexagonal prismatic 
crystals composed of carbonate of lime. Such calcareous concre- 
ments are often found in the animal organism in the neighbourhood 
of nerves ; as for instance in Frogs by the sides of the vertebral 
column near the exit of the spinal nerves. A red pigment which 
moreover generally distinguishes these marginal corpuscles, (it is 
sometimes wanting,) caused EHRENBERG to conjecture that they 
were eyes 3 . There is more probability in KOELLIKER'S idea, that 
they are to be considered as auditory organs 4 . Even in vertebrates 
little stones or grit of carbonate of lime are found in the auditory 
sac or vestibule of the membranous Labyrinth. In Beroe and the 
allied genera only a single organ of the sort is found, a pedunculated 
vesicle with calcareous crystals at that end of the body which is 
opposite to the mouth 5 . 

The apparatus for motion consists of transparent muscular 
fibres, having sometimes a longitudinal, sometimes a circular 
course : they exhibit the same microscopic transverse stripes which 
are characteristic of the voluntary muscles of higher creatures 6 . 

Several of the Animals belonging to this Class are phospho- 
rescent. According to EHRENBERG the Arabians on the Red Sea

name the entire family of Medusae Sea- Candles (Kandil el Bahr 1 ). 
Bosc, and other writers after him, went too far when they main- 
tained that all Medusa, nay all Acalephes (EscHSCHOLTz) are 
phosphorescent. Still, not Medusse alone, but other Acalephes also 
do possess this property : the phenomenon has been observed in 
species of Beroe ( Cydippe pileus, Eucharis multicornis, &c.) : Ste- 
phanomia also diffuses a lively light by night. This phosphorescence 
is a vital phenomenon, and ceases on the death of the animals : 
though some of them, like other organic substances, are luminous 
even after death ; but that light is of a different nature from phos- 
phorescence during life. Thus WILL, for instance, saw Beroe ru- 
fescens emit a light after death, which differed by its bluish-green 
colour from the yellowish-red irradiations of the living animal. 
Dead Acalephce, or mucus arising from decomposition of animal sub- 
stances, can contribute little or nothing to the gorgeous spectacle 
of the illumination of the sea, of which so many voyagers have 
given striking descriptions : the chief cause of the brilliant sparks 
resides in minute marine animals, especially Medusae, like the 
species which SURIRAY named Noctiluca miliaris, and which, being 
not larger than a pin's head, looks like a globule of mucus to the 
naked eye 2 . 

Acalephes are met with in all seas. A very large number of 
species occur in the Mediterranean belonging to the most different 
forms. In the seas of the cold and temperate zones scarcely any 
Siphonophorce are found, at least not in the northern hemisphere ; 
however the currents may occasionally bring with them southern 
forms from a distance, as is proved by the fact that OWEN, on the 
south-west coast of England, observed Velella and Porpita, and 
HYNDMAN, on the coast of Ireland, Diphyes 3 . Some species are 
widely diffused, asAurelia aurita, and Cyancea capillata: the first was

found by EHRENBERG in the Red Sea, and he could not discover 
any difference between it and that found in the northern and the 
Baltic seas. Oftentimes many species of Medusae are collected in 
such quantities at certain places, that they form as it were banks 
in the sea, which it requires days to sail through 1 . In fine calm 
weather Medusae come to the surface : during storms they seek the 
quieter waters of the depths.

SYSTEMATIC 
ARRANGEMENT OF ACALEPH^. 



CLASS III. 
ACALEPH^E. 

GELATINOUS animals, swimming freely. Stomach included in 
the parenchyme of the body, without an abdominal cavity ; canals 
arising from the stomach, filled with water. Ovaries and testes in 
one and the same individual or the sexes distinct without organs 
of copulation. Vestiges of a nervous system not always distinct. 
Arrangement of parts usually quaternarian. 

ORDER I. SiphonopJiorce. 

[Swimming Polyps without tentacles round the mouth, attached 
to a common stem of variable length, and moving freely by means 
of special swimming apparatus, with prehensile filaments, feelers, 
and protective covers or bracts, or some only of these organs, 
attached mediately or immediately to the same common stem.] 

This first order includes the A caUphes hydrostatiques of CUVIER 
and a part of his Acalephes simples. 

Family I. Velellidce or Chondrophorce. Common body, sup- 
ported by a cartilaginous 1 lamina, which is cellular internally. 

The part of the body which faces upward is supported by a 
disc, which in Porpita is even in some degree calcareous, and con- 



f 1 The disc contains horny substance, not cartilage, according to LEUCKART.] 



ACALEPHJE. 109 

tains cells which are full of air. Above, this disc is covered by the 
integument alone; below, it sustains all the parts of which the 
[compound] animal consists. 

[The shell of Velella with its horizontal and perpendicular plates 
consists of a single piece. The thicker horizontal portion is formed 
of two lamiiise connected by perpendicular concentric pieces, so that 
annular canals are formed which are filled with air. These canals 
communicate with each other in Velella, but not in Porpita : in both 
they open externally by many minute pores on the upper surface. 
The soft parts constitute a mantle which covers the shell and projects 
beyond its edge by a free border. At the inferior excavated portion 
of the shell, the mantle has on its outside the attached polyps and 
appendages, on the inside the large liver. 

The polyps are of two sorts, a single large and central polyp, and 
many small ones disposed around it in irregular rows. They have 
been designated " stomachs " and " suctorial tubes." But observers 
do not agree respecting their function. LESSON attributes to both sets 
a digestive power, Voyage de la Goquille, pp. 49 56, and Acalephes 
p. 561 : whilst Y. SIEBOLD Vergl. Anat. s. 63, note, thinks that the 
smaller polyps alone discharge the office of digestion, and consigns 
the large one to the respiratory system : and HOLLAED Ann. des Sc. 
Nat. T. in. 1845, p. 250, says that the large central pouch is the 
stomach and the small ones canaux aquiferes. KOELLIKER however 
assures us that he has found small Crustacea both in the large and 
the small tubes, and has seen the residue of digestion pass from 
them all indifferently. Consequently we conclude with him and 
others, that the Velellidce are colonies or compound animals. 

The liver is a large brownish mass placed above the central 
stomach : it fills the inferior cavity of the horizontal plate. It is a 
collection of fine canals formed of homogeneous membrane lined 
with brown cells. A certain number of the canals branch from two 
openings in the base of the central polyp : they frequently anastomose 
and form a network on the surface of the liver from which fine 
vessels pass to the perpendicular plate and to the margin of the 
horizontal plate (Velella). These vessels, then, would seem to have 
received the nutriment which has passed from the central stomach 
into the liver-canals, for the purpose of redistribution to the soft 
parts when it has been modified by the biliary secretion. Of the 
smaller polyps a few, which hang beneath that part of the liver which 
projects beyond the large polyp, open into liver-canals: but the 



110 CLASS III. 

greater part of them have no connexion with these canals, or with 
the central polyp, but lateral branches of the vessels open into their 
pedicles, so that they at once give the product of digestion to the 
vascular system. In Porpita the lesser polyps open into liver-canals 
and not into vessels. 

The generative organs are seated, as clusters of minute bodies, on 
the pedicles of the smaller polyps. They become transparent and 
pyramidal, and having gradually assumed the medusan form are 
detached. They were first noticed by DELLE CHIAJE, Descriz. iv. 
p. 107, Tav. 146, fig. 10, 12. The sexual germs are formed on the 
wall of the radiating vessels. HUXLEY, GEGENBAUER, 1. 1. 

The prehensive organs are placed around the lesser polyps on the 
horizontal margin of the mantle. They are hollow and open into a 
vessel like the lesser polyps. They have no special nettle-nodes, but 
numerous scattered thread-cells. 

The air-canals were discovered by KROHN ; they are minute vessels 
which pass from the innermost air-spaces of the horizontal cartilage, 
perforate the mass of the liver, and reach the walls of the polyps 
where they appear to terminate by closed extremities. They are 
most numerous in Porpita. See KOELLIKER Die Siphonoph. pp. 46 
64.] 

Velella LAM. A semi-orbicular crest, compressed, containing a 
cartilage within, placed obliquely albove the disc. Marginal ten- 
tacles simple.

According to FORSKAL the French sailors call the animal Vallette: they 
eat it fried with flour and butter. The name Velella appears to be derived 
from velum and from the crest, which like a full-spread sail, adorns the 
upper surface. The beautiful blue colour of the animal is imparted to the 
water in which it is examined, but disappears in spirit of wine. During 
life the creature is not unattractive ("non invenusta est quantum vermi 
licet," FORSK. Descr. Animal, p. 105) ; see the coloured figure of LESUEUR 
in PERON, Voyage aux terres austr. PI. xxx. fig. 6. (This species is from the

Note. If the figures in FORSKAL, Tab. xxvi. fig. k^, k^ k$, belong to 
a young Velella, as appears from the explanation of the plate, this genus 
must be suppressed ; which is BLAINVILLE'S opinion.

Family II. Physsophoridce (Hydrostatica Cuv.) Body sus- 
pended in the water by means of a swim-bladder or of receptacles 
filled with air. 

Bladder-bearers. The opinion that these animals are able to 
expel the air from the air-bladder at will was rendered doubtful, as 
a general rule, by OLFEKS, who could find no opening in the large 
bladder of Physalia. [Subsequent observations however have deter- 
mined that Physalia is the only one of the Physsophoridce whose 
bladder does really communicate with the external air. But, though 
there be no such communication in the rest, LEUCKART states that 
in many of them (and he believes it to be true of all) the air may 
be readily caused to pass from the cavity of the bladder into that of 
the common stem, by the expansion of the upper extremity of which 
the air-bladder is in all cases surrounded. 

a) with short stem or axis without swimming bells. 

Physalia LAM. Swimming bladder very large, crested above, 
with an aperture at one extremity : the whole of the common stem 
expanded so as to form a receptacle for it : from the inferior surface 
of the expanded stem the polyps are suspended together with 
feelers and prehensile organs, of different thickness and of great 
length.] 

/Sea-bladder. The colony swims constantly on the surface of the 
sea, and for that purpose makes use of the crest on the top of the 
bladder as a sail. Hence its name, het bezaantje, the Portuguese 
man of war, la petite galere, &c. If in the nomenclature we ought 
strictly to hold to priority, then this genus ought to be named 



112 CLASS III. 

Salacia, for thus LINN^US announced it in the earlier editions of his 
Syst. Nat. ; in the tenth and following editions it is no longer met 
with, and LINNJEUS afterwards arranged the species known to him 
under the genus Holothuria. 

VON OLFERS especially threw much light upon the organisation of 
this genus by the investigation of Physalia caravella ESCHSCH. (Phys. 
arethusa TILES.) A Physalia has two bladders, the internal is 
filled with air, and was described by OLFERS as perfectly closed; the 
external has an aperture situated at one extremity and surrounded 
by a sphincter. 

[QUATREFAGES has described the action of this sphincter muscle, 
and the connexion of both bladders with the aperture ; he also 
caused the air contained in the interior bladder to be analysed, and 
found that it contained less of oxygen than atmospheric air by about 
3 per cent. : the animal appeared to be able to expel the air volunta- 
rily at intervals, and to distend the bladder again after a short time: 
it would therefore seem to be a respiratory organ for the colony : the 
air-bladder is surrounded on all sides by the external bladder or 
envelope, which is in fact the expanded stem of the colony : with the 
under surface of this the various appendages are connected, and into 
its cavity the cavities of them, all open more or less directly : the 
bladder in Physalia did not appear to QUATREFAGES * to be merely a 
passive organ, for besides the power of emptying and distending it 
the animal seemed to be able to direct the fluid contained in the 
cavity of the appendages into this or that bundle of them at will, 
and so to alter the position of the center of gravity of the bladder, 
and by thus bringing different regions of it to the surface to steer 
its course.] 

The larger and smaller tentacles are capable of extension and 
contraction, and serve probably for feeling and seizing. Small 
clumps of red corpuscles, which are situated between the larger 
tentacles, are, according to OLFERS, eggs : but the sexual organs of 
the Physsophoridce require further investigation.

points project somewhat beyond them when the coronet opens, but lie entirely 
concealed when it closes. The feelers are more numerous than the polyps 
(n 20), long and nearly filiform, and play between the bracts when they

Physsophora (from (f)v<ra or cpva-a-a), literally bladder-bearer, was

The species are not sufficiently distinguished ; FOKSKAEL figured an im- 
perfect specimen, which for the most part had lost the suctorial tubes and 
other appendages. The figure given by PHILIPPI not long ago represents 
the animal in an uninjui'ed state ; this writer supposes that the specimen 
found by him in the Mediterranean belongs to another species, which he 
names Physsophora tetrasticha. There are four rows of swimnvng bells, and 
in each row four. See his Memoir in MUELLER'S Archiv. 1843, s. 58 67,

114 CLASS ITT. 

[See KOELLIKER'S description of a new species (1. 1. p. 19, Tab. v.) found by 
him at Messina, and which he calls Physs. PJdlippi. The type of Physsophora 
is distinguished by the very small length of the axis below the swimming 
column. The column is as usual terminated by a small bladder above the bells 
filled with air. Beneath it the polyps, feelers, prehensile and sexual organs 
are all compressed into a small space. The feelers surround the axis immedi- 
ately beneath the bells in a continuous coronet, like the calyx of a flower. 
They are described by KOELLIKER as exceedingly sensitive, in constant 
motion, and even laying hold of prey. Within the circlet of feelers arise 
the Polyps, each with its prehensile filament. The nettle-node has an 
exceptional formation. There are no bracts or covers, their protective office 
being supplied by the near neighbourhood of the swimming column. The 
sexual organs are seated in bunches on the stem close to the Polyps, a pair 
of different sex at the base of every Polyp.

Stephanomia PERON, ESCHSCH. Swimming bells numerous, 
forming a conical column which surrounds the stem with many 
spiral turns. Polyps set on the stem by a long, slender, contractile 
pedicle. Feelers pediculate affixed to the stem, usually in threes 
between two successive Polyps. Bracts or covers not confined to 
the stem, but also surrounding the base of the Polyps as the calyx 
a flower. Prehensile filaments very long with lateral branches 
at regular intervals bearing a node and terminating in a single 
thread. Sexual organs in bunches close set on the feelers from 
the stem. 

The Stephanomia uvaria of LESUEUR does not, according to 
KOELLIKER, differ from Apolemia ESCHSCH. 

In a specimen of Stephanomia four feet in length LEUCKART 
counted no less than 20 spiral turns in the swimming column, with 
10 12 bells in each turn. The three feelers from the stem are two 
on a common pedicle and one sessile. The male and female organs 



ACALEPHJE. 115 

are in close proximity to each other at the base of the double feelers. 
The male are the least numerous, the form oval, slightly medusan, 
the nucleus as it ripens passing from red to yellow : there are four 
radial canals and a circular canal, the mantle lying close to the 
nucleus and having an opening. The female appendages are smaller 
and round, but of similar structure, except that the central vessel of 
the nucleus is not developed, for each appendage contains only a 
single egg. Compare the interesting observations and figures of

The prehensile filaments give off branches which again subdivide to terminate 
in two threads : a contractile bladder is seated below the point of last divi- 
sion, and immediately before this is a spiral nettle-node covered by a bell- 
shaped duplicature from the filament on which it is placed. Agalmopsis 
punctata KOELL., a new species, differs from the last in the branches of the 
prehensile organs having the node without a cover, and in terminating 
without further division: also the feelers have special prehensile organs 
which are knotted.

consisting of a single polyp and its appendages.] 

This family includes certain marine animals, transparent as glass, 
which swim by means of the contraction of hollow organs filled 
with water ; it has the genus Diphyes for its type, which was first 
formed by CUVIER in the first edition of his Rdgne Animal, iv. p. 61. 
This genus rested on a species discovered by BORY DE SAINT- 
VINCENT at the beginning of this century (1801), in the South 
Atlantic Ocean, and described under the name of Salpa bipartite; 
see his Voyage dans les quatre principales ttes des Mers d'Afrique, 






ACALEPH^E. 117 

1. 1804, p. 134, PL vi. fig. 3, A, B, C. The two pieces provided with 
swimming cavities, nearly similar in form, were afterwards, by 
CUVIER (Eegne Anim. sec. ed. in. p. 288) and other writers, 
erroneously taken to be two animals which had become attached 
to each other, an opinion occasioned by observing that they 
were readily separated. This separation, or spontaneous detach- 
ment of different parts, has often been remarked in the entire 
order as in Physsophora, Ehizophysa, Stephanomia. In fact, 
Diphyes is much more nearly allied to these genera than might 
be suspected from many, and sometimes very confused, descriptions 
of it. I may remark, that the part which, in our description, 
we have indicated as anterior, is called posterior by the first 
discoverer, BOEY, and by many others after him. 

QUOY and GAIMARD, who discovered many new species of this 
family and formed new genera from them, (Ann. des Sc. nat. 
Tom. x. 1827, p. 5 21,) determined subsequently to bring them 
all under the single genus Diphyes, (Voyage de decouvertes de 
I' Astrolabe, Zoolog. Tom. iv. 1833, p. 81). [But more accurate 
observations of late years have shewn that this proceeding is not 
advisable. In Praya the swimming bells are similar in form, 
and are placed, more or less, side by side, and their cavities 
open on opposite sides of the stem. In Diphyes the bells are 
placed behind one another and open backwards. 

The common stem begins within the substance of the anterior 
bell, or piece, in a more expanded portion, which is lined with 
large epithelial cells, and has very different form in different genera. 
This expanded portion often contains a globule of oily matter. 
Beneath it the stem gives origin to the canals of the swimming 
pieces, and then is prolonged to become the common axis of the 
colony. 

The polyps with their different appendages are fixed to the stem 
at regular intervals. Those nearest to the swimming pieces are 
quite undeveloped and without appendages. Those at the other 
extremity of the stem are the oldest and most perfect, and have 
their appendages most complete. Each group consists of a Polyp, 
a set of prehensile organs, and the generative organ, which partakes 
more or less of the medusan form the whole being covered by 
a protecting bract. Such a group either persists in adhering to the 
common stem, (Diphyes, Praya), and then only certain parts are 
detached, as the medusiform capsules of the sexual organs ; or it is 



118 CLASS III. 

capable, to a certain degree, of independent existence, and when 
fully developed, separates itself from the stem of the colony (Abyla). 
In the Prayidce, the covers are bounded by round surfaces above, 
and have a cavity below, like a helmet, to receive the other members 
of the group : in Diphyes they surround the stem like a rolled leaf, 
(differing, however, in form in the different species) and adhere to 
it by the narrow part. In Abyla they cover the members of the 
group imperfectly, are almost solid, yet with a cavity in the interior 
which is in connexion with that of the stem, and which is lined by 
large cells. In all these groups the sexual buds are more or less 
medusiform, and may be developed into a swimming bell. They 
sprout from the base of the Polyp.]

The genera Eudoxia, Erscea, Aglaisma ESCHSCH., which have 
only a single polyp, have been termed monogastric diphyidce by 
HUXLEY ; but it is almost certain that they are not independent 
genera. It has been noted above, when treating of Abyla penta- 
gona, that a single group of this compound diphyes exactly resem- 
bles Eudoxia cuboides; and here the groups have been seen to 
detach themselves from the colony both by LEUCKART and by GEGEN- 
BAUER as indeed the same fact had previously been observed by 
SARS in his Diphyes truncata. Eudoxia campanulata is believed by 
LEUCKART to be a group of Diph. acuminata, a new species observed 
by him at Nice j whilst he has found that Aglaisma pentagonum is 
not a monogastric diphyes, but an imperfectly developed Abyla pen- 
tagona, see Zoologisch. Untersuch. s. 54. Erscea is suspected by 
LEUCKART to be a detached group of Diphyes Koch. WILL. 

Eudoxia (&c.) consists of a cover or bract, a polyp with its pre- 
hensile organs, a swimming bell (sexual capsule), and usually a 
smaller bell sprouting from the base of the polyp, which is destined 
to replace the larger when this has been detached. These parts 
are all connected by their canals to a portion of common stem.]

ORDER II. Ctenophorce, or Beroecea. 

Mouth simple, stomach situated in the axis of the body. Vibra- 
tile cilia disposed in rows on the surface of the body. Swimming 
bladders none. 

The Beroecious animals are Acalephs of very different form, 
which, however, are distinguished from the former order by the 
absence of swimming bladders [bells] and cartilaginous laminse, as 



120 CLASS III. 

well as suctorial mouths : [they are single animals, in short, and not 
colonies.] The projecting edges, usually named ribs (costce) which 
are beset with cilia, especially characterise this family : whence the 
German name Rippenquallen. Whether these vibratile cilia, whih 
occasionally are so arranged as to form vibrating laminae, do really 
cause the progression of these animals, as is usually assumed, is in 
consequence of the objections raised by MERTENS and by WILL 
(Iforce Tergest. s. 8 13) exceedingly doubtful. 

The name Eeroe given by BROWN (Nat. Hist, of Jamaica) to the 
animal discovered by him in the middle of the last century, is 
borrowed from Mythology ; it is that of one of the numerous 
daughters of Oceanus :

In bringing these numerous genera together, and giving greater 
extension to the name Callianira, than has been done by former 
writers, my sole object is to facilitate the review, and at the 
same time to indicate the affinity of these animals. Beyond doubt 
the genera are too numerous here. The genus Buceplialon of 
LESSON (Callianira bucephalon REYNAUD, LESS. Centur. zool. PL 28) 
also belongs here, and probably does not differ from Calymma 
Trevirani.

ORDER III. Discophorce. 

Body disciform or campanulate, above naked, below usually 
provided with arms or tentacles. 

The Meduso'ids or Sea-blubber. They have a gelatinous disc, on 
the upper surface more or less spherical, which from its form has 
been compared to an umbrella or a hood ; the form has some re- 
semblance to toad-stools (agarici). These animals move themselves 
by expansion and contraction of the hood. The mouth, or the suc- 
torial organs which take the place of the mouth, are situated in the 
center of the inferior surface, sometimes elongated into a pedicle 
and provided with different tentacles. On this difference are 
founded the numerous genera which modern writers have felt jus- 
tified in adopting.

It is not so completely established that all the forms here brought 
together are really characterised by the absence of a simple mouth. 
WILL at least, in the animals placed by him in the genus Geryonia, 
found a mouth surrounded by four lobes. In some the pedicle is 
supplied at its extremity with a folded appendage (Geryonia), in 
others at its base, or at its extremity, it is beset with threads :

a great size. The Rhizostoma has four pairs of suctorial arms, which are 
provided with absorbent vessels ; by these it receives its nutriment, which 
consequently consists of minute animalcules, or of animal matters in 
solution. These absorbent vessels and their branches coalesce into four 
stems, which run along the pedicle and end in the stomach. From the 
stomach run laterally vessels through the hood. Surrounding the stomach 
are four cavities, with very wide opening below, in which the organs 
of propagation are seated. The uppermost portion of the hood consists of 
a substance more firm than the rest of the body. See K. W. EYSENHARDT,

contain the organs for propagation, were by PERON and LAMARCK 
incorrectly considered to be four mouths.

Anim. edit, ill., Zooph. The four arms are considerably longer in old than 
in younger specimens ; these arms consist of two laminae crumpled at the 
edges, which during life face each other in such a way as to form a canal ; 
after death they are flaccid and parted asunder. The disc is not quite 
circular, but in some degree divided by indentations of the margin into 
eight lobes. The four arms unite at the center of the body to form a 
circular aperture : this mouth leads to the stomach, which has four lateral 
cavities. From the stomach there run sixteen vessels to the margin of the 
disc, of which eight, divided into branches, alternate with eight others un- 
divided and open at the margin. In addition, there are eight corpuscles at 
the margin, which EHRENBERG considers to be eyes, and which were noticed 
above. This species is found in the North Sea and the Baltic. Comp.

each side of every ray as folded borders, but they do not extend as far as 
the margin. (EsCHSCHOLTZ divided the Discophorce into Cryptocarpce and 
Phanerocarpce, Syst. der Acal. p. 41 ; to the last, which have the sexual 
organs placed crucially in the disc and attracting observation by their 
colour, belong the Rhizostomidce and Medusidce ; to the first the Geryonidce, 
Oceanidce and ^Equoridce ; in all of these the sexual organs have not yet 
been detected, but they will probably be found at the under side of the 
disc, and since in ^Equorea molacea, according to the observations of 
MILNE EDWARDS, they strike the eye on this surface, and are also dis- 
tinguished by their violet colour, we cannot accept the name Crypto- 
carpce.

genera, to which may be added Staurophora BRANDT, form a family 
in the system of ESCHSCHOLTZ, to which he has given the name 
JBerenicidce. This family appears to me to be doubtful, as it does to 
BRANDT and others ; we must leave the decision to time, I prefer 
to wait the result of new observations, rather than to attribute to 
Acalephs nutrition by superficial absorption. 

For the rest, several genera of Acalephs are founded on. figures of 
authors alone and these sometimes imperfect and faulty. Hence 
no part of Zoology is more uncertain than this. 

Accordingly there are many genera which I have not recorded, 
and possibly more might have been omitted. For here excess of 
timidity is better than dearth of prudence. 



CLASS IV. 
ECHINODERMS (ECHINODERMATA) 1 . 

THE name JEchmodermata was used by J. T. KLEIN rather 
more than a century ago, to denote the shells of the sea-urchins, 
called Echini. 'E^II/OS, with the Greeks, denoted both an urchin 
and a sea-urchin. Afterwards BRUGUIERES gave the name of 
Echinodermata to a division of the animal kingdom that comprised 
at once the sea-urchins and the star-fishes. CUVIER retained that 
name for this division, but added to it animals having a coriaceous 
skin without spines or quills. Although the name is no longer 
applicable to all the species of this class, yet the class itself must 
be looked upon as an extremely natural division of the Animal 
Kingdom. These animals are distinguished by an intestinal canal 
hanging free in the cavity of the body by single threads or mem- 
branes, usually long and tortuous, or provided with lateral append- 
ages if it be short: blood vessels and respiratory organs are present; 
the genital organs, in both sexes of the same external form, are 
without any special apparatus for copulation ; the fertilisation being

effected by means of the sea-water in which these animals live. 
When parts are multiple, the number five prevails as remarkably 
in this class, as did the number four in the preceding : and the 
quintuple organisation is often obvious, as in star-fishes and sea- 
urchins, in the external form of the body. This is round or some- 
what pentagonal in the sea-urchins ; flat and spread out in rays in 
the star-fishes, with the mouth on the inferior surface. The Holo- 
thurice have, on the contrary, a cylindrical body. 

In the star-fishes, of which the body is flat, the mouth conducts 
to a wide stomach that fills the disc of the body. It was supposed 
formerly that this stomach was in all of them a blind sac, as 
TlEDEMANN has described it in Asterias aurantiaca (Astropecten 
aurantiacus MUELL. and TE.) Afterwards MECKEL detected in 
Comatulce a second opening of the intestinal canal, that lies on the 
same surface of the body with the mouth 1 . Only lately it has 
become apparent from MUELLER'S investigations, that in most of 
the proper Asterice an anus exists, and that the structure in Ast. 
aurantiaca is to be considered as the exception rather than the 
rule. But this second opening does not lie, as in the Comatulce, 
on the same surface as the mouth, but opposite to it, on the back 
of the disc. In the Opliiurce and Euryale it is wanting: conse- 
quently these, with some star-fishes (the genera Astropecten, Cteno- 
discus, and Luidia .of the moderns), and some Crinoids are the 
only Echinoderms in which the intestinal canal forms a blind sac, 
as in the Anthozoa. In the Asterice proper, the intestinal canal has 
csecal appendages, which divide into branches, and fill the rays of 
the body ; in those species whose intestinal canal is a blind sac, 
the appendages proceed laterally' from the stomach, at whose base 
on the dorsal surface there are usually two cgecal appendages in 
addition. In those Asterise which have an anal opening, the 
stomach is divided by a circular fold from a second compartment, 
to which the cgecal appendages of the rays are attached ; to this 
succeeds a third compartment, the rectum, a short straight tube, 
which has also csecal appendages ; sometimes they are placed round 
the intestine in rays, like the appendages of the rays, and fill up

the spaces between the rays. In the disciform genus Culcita, the 
appendages of the rectum are greatly developed, five in number, 
each divided into two branches, and clustered 1 . In Ophiura and 
Euryale the csecal stomach has lateral recesses, or even branched 
blind appendages, mostly ten in number, which, however, do not 
penetrate the rays. In Comatula the intestinal canal is tubular, 
and winds round a spongy structure in the axis of the disc ; from 
this an edge projects, that penetrates into the canal and forms a 
valve 2 . In the sea-urchins (Echinus} the intestinal canal is very 
long. The oesophagus is tortuous, narrow, and beset with numerous 
follicles. Where it passes into the much wider intestinal canal, 
there is a csecal appendage. The walls of the canal are very thin : 
its course is close to the shell in five arcs directed outwards ; when 
it has returned nearly to the point from whence it began, it bends 
round and follows a similar route in an opposite direction, until at 
last, having become somewhat narrower, it mounts up to the anus 
(at the uppermost part of the shell). In the Holothurice the intes- 
tinal canal is nearly of the same width throughout. It proceeds 
from the mouth along one side of the body to the lower extremity, 
then bends back to the anterior part, and finally descends along the 
other side to the cloaca, into which the respiratory organs also 
open. In Echiurus the intestinal canal is, in like manner, mucli 
longer than the body, and makes many convolutions : it has numer- 
ous cystiform widenings, and very thin walls. In $ipunculus, 
where the anus is placed not at the end, but in the anterior half of 
the body, the intestinal canal, with its threefold bending, is nearly 
four times the length of the body. In Synapta, on the other hand, 
it is nearly straight, and about the length of the body, the anus 
being at the posterior extremity 3 . In the star-fishes probably the 
radiating appendages are to be considered as organs for preparing 
bile (liver) : they are filled in Ast. rumens with a yellow turbid 
fluid 4 .

Notwithstanding much careful investigation, there still exists 
great obscurity about the circulation of the blood in Ecliinoderms. 
TIEDEMANN and DELLE CHIAJE give very conflicting descriptions 
of the vascular system the difference being founded in the inter- 
pretation of the dermal vessels, which are connected with the 
organs of motion. The first of these authors considers the motion 
of fluid observed in these vessels to be altogether distinct from the 
circulation, whilst, according to the other, they are a part of the 
system of blood-vessels. In Asterias TIEDEMANN found on the 
inner surface of the skin of the back, a vascular ring, which he 
considers to be venous. The vessels which run upon the surface 
of the visceral appendages of the rays open into this ring. From 
it a canal arises, which performs the office of a heart, lying near 
the so-called lime-canal which is found there. The canal runs 
into a vascular circle surrounding the mouth, which TIEDEMANN 
holds to be arterial, and from which branches proceed to the 
intestines. Besides these two vascular rings (one on the dorsal 
and one on the abdominal surface), there is a third ring of an 
orange-yellow colour found on the inferior surface beneath the skin. 
TIEDEMANN was not able to discover any communication between 
this ring and the rest of the vascular system. In Echinus vascular 
rings occur, in like manner, round the mouth and the anus, on each 
surface two, of which one is to be considered arterial, the other 
venous. The heart is oblong, divided into many cells, and lying 
on the oesophagus 1 . In Holothuria there is a circulating system 
without a heart, or rather the heart has the form of a contractile 
vessel, that runs at the outside on the surface of the intestine. 
At the anterior extremity of the intestinal canal this vessel forms a 
vascular circle, whence very fine branches arise ; when near the 
anus it has become small, having given off a multitude of fine 
branches, which run on the surface of the intestine. There is a 
transverse vessel which connects the longitudinal trunk on the first 
loop of intestine with that on the second. Many intestinal veins, 
which seem at the same time to perform the part of absorbents or

lymphatics, run upon the mesentery to form a stem, having a 
curved course, from which other vessels arise to run to the respira- 
tory organ and so may be named pulmonary arteries. With these 
pulmonary arteries the pulmonary veins are in connexion, from 
whose union a longitudinal stem arises from which branches proceed 
to the arterial vessel with which we began our description l . 

Besides the blood-vessels already described there are other 
vessels which in Echinoderms provided with suckers or feet are in 
connexion with these organs of motion. The integument of the 
body is perforated by numerous pores arranged regularly in rows ; 
in the sea-urchins the rows have been called, on account of their 
regularity, Ambulacra, from a comparison with orderly rows of 
trees and garden- walks. Through these pores membraneous cylin- 
drical feelers (the feet) pass out, each terminating in a minute 
suctorial disc. According to the investigations of VALENTIN these 
feelers are in Echini perforated at their extremity by a fine aperture. 
Within the integument there are vesicles in connexion with them. 
The feelers, hollow within, are filled with a fluid, usually sea- 
water, which the animal can press at will from the vesicles, or, by 
contraction of the former, can cause to flow back. In this way the 
animals move their body, the numerous feet contracting and elon- 
gating, and adhering by means of the suckers. There are vessels 
corresponding to the rows of feet or feelers, from which lateral 
branches proceed to the vesicles of the feelers. The ordinary 
number of these longitudinal vessels of the integument is five ; in 
the star-fishes their number corresponds with the number of the 
rays of the body. These lymphatics fall into an annular vessel 
surrounding the mouth. In Holothuria the appendages of the 
feelers which surround the mouth proceed from this annular vessel : 
and from it there arise also five other vessels that descend along the 
commencement of the intestinal tube, where they terminate in 
another annular vessel from which one or two oblong csecal vesicles 
depend (Ampulla Poliana), that are in like manner filled with 
watery fluid 2 .

object of respiration, may be effected in any part of the animal 
organism, where the finest branches of the blood-vessels (the 
Capillaries) are bathed in the medium in which the animal lives. 
Hence it is easy to conceive that this function is not always neces- 
sarily connected with determinate parts. 

In almost all Echinodertns the sea-water penetrates into the 
cavity of the body, and bathes as well the internal surface of the 
integument as the outer surface of the intestines. Where no 
especial respiratory organ exists, the function of such an organ, the 
change of the blood, may be effected in the fine vessels which run 
on the surface of the intestinal tube. 

In the Star-fishes the sea-water penetrates to the cavity of the 
body by means of fine tubules in the integument, which are found 
in great numbers on the dorsal surface x . In Ophiura there are on 
the abdominal surface in each of the five fields between two rays, 
two or four fissures leading into the cavity of the body. 

In the Echini it is not known with certainty in what way the 
water penetrates the cavity of the body. The ten branched organs 
round the mouth, which TIEDEMANN considers to be tubules to 
convey the water in and out, have, according to VALENTIN, no 
external apertures 2 . 

As little is known hitherto of the course which the water takes 
in most Holothurice to reach their cavity. In those which have no 
special respiratory organ, the genus Synapta has between the ten- 
tacles that surround the mouth four or five small papilliform 
eminences, having an opening at the apex and conducting to as 
many tubules that open between the muscles of the mouth. The 
openings are beset with cilia, like the tubules of the integument in 
Star-fishes 3 . In other Holothurice, as in those which TIEDEMANN 
investigated, there are special respiratory organs. From the Cloaca 
in which the intestinal canal terminates, there proceeds upwards 
a short tube, that soon divides into two very long principal branches 
which run as far as the anterior part of the intestinal canal. From 
these smaller tubes arise which subdivide into twigs which termi- 



1 [This is TIEDEMANN'S opinion with respect to star-fishes, but the observations of 
SHARPEY, EHRENBERG and MUELLER, are opposed to it ; they saw the streams of 
water from within turn back when they reached the extremity of the tubules.]

nate in csecal vesicles, or pulmonary cells. The right branch is 
intimately connected with the intestinal veins ; the left branch of 
the respiratory organ is connected, by means of muscular fibres, 
with the internal surface of the integument. The form of this 
respiratory organ agrees with that of Lung, although Holothuria^ 
breathe water and not air. These parts are very contractile : in 
a Holothuria that was opened alive they did not cease, as long as 
life lasted, to force the water in and out by alternate contraction and 
expansion. But in respiration it is not the contraction of the 
muscular membrane alone of these branches that acts, but the 
contractility of the common integument of the body also. This con- 
tractility of the skin is so great, that occasionally, when the creature 
is irritated, a portion of the intestines together with the right 
branch of the respiratory organ is forcibly ejected from the Cloaca. 

In the Sea-urchins VALENTIN considers the ten branched organs 
surrounding the mouth, first described by TIEDEMANN (and noticed 
above, vid. p. 132), to be external gills. As internal gills KROHN 1 
and VALENTIN consider the foliated vesicles, which, in the interior 
of the shell, are in connexion with the ambulacral tubules : and 
which have a closely-woven vascular net-work. VALENTIN found, 
as has been stated, the ambulacral tubules perforated at the extre- 
mity in Sea-urchins. Through these openings the water penetrates 
into the vesicles, and the general opinion that the fluid is urged 
into the tubules from the vesicles and so distends them is not valid, 
according to VALENTIN, in the case of Sea-urchins 2 . In that of 
the Star-fishes and Holothurice, where the tubules appear to be im- 
perforate, it has not been satisfactorily made out to what extent, if 
at all, the attached vesicles contribute to the respiratory act. 

The organs for propagation are in different families of this class 
of a different form, but still, as was stated above, have, in the two 
sexes of the same species, exactly the same form. Hence, it 
appears that the discovery of the different sexes belongs exclusively 
to the latest scientific period, since formerly it was believed that all 
the individuals were of the same sex, either really bisexual or solely 
female 3 .

:? WAGNER first discovered the difference of sex in Holothuria tubulosa; then PETERS, 

1840, in Echinus, RATHKE in Ophiura and Sea-stars, &c. 



134 CLASS IV. 

Yet, without microscopic investigation, even,, the colour of the 
organs of propagation is sufficient to point out the difference of the 
sexes; the testes are distinguished by a milk-white, the ovaria by 
a yellowish-brown or red colour. In ninety-eight specimens of 
Echinus PETERS found that forty-three were males and fifty-five 
females, so that the two sexes are nearly equal in numbers. In 
Comatula also, MUELLER found the sexes distinct ; the ovaria and 
testes are here situated on the pinnulce *. In Ophiura, on the other 
hand, they lie in the disc, round the stomach as ten structures 
composed of lobes and blind pouches, that run into a pedicle ; in 
the spaces between every two rays two such structures are placed 
close together so as to form five pairs 2 . In the Star-fishes they lie 
in the angles between the rays, and have the form of bunches of 
beaded strings : in some species they extend into the rays ; their 
number is double that of the rays. On the dorsal surface, in some 
species, in each inter-radial space, two spots are found, which are 
perforated, sieve-like, by numerous closely arranged pores ; these 
openings allow the ova or the seed to escape. In other species the 
products of the genital organs, which have been poured into the 
cavity of the body are probably allowed to pass out by the respira- 
tory tubules on the back. In the Sea-urchins five ovaries or testes 
lie on the inner surface of the shell, and fill the spaces between the 
ambulacral plates. They are of an oblong flattened form, and con- 
sist of numerous csecal pouches, which open into an excretory duct 
running through the midst of the organ. The duct then runs freely 
like a footstalk, by which the testis or the ovary is attached to the 
upper surface of the shell where it opens. There are thus five such 
openings, in five pentagonal calcareous plates around the anus. In 
Holothurice the ovary or testis is a bundle of branched tubes ; these 
hang by their blind extremities downwards, and open above into 
a single excretory duct, being fastened to it like a brush. The 
oviduct or the efferent vessel lies along the anterior portion of the 
intestinal canal, and terminates near the anterior extremity of the 
body by a distinct opening on the dorsal surface. Near this canal

are situated pear-shaped vesicles, collected in some species into 
bunches, which TIEDEMANN conceives to be male genital organs, 
an opinion which falls to the ground now that the sexes are known 
to be distinct. Moreover they do not lead into this canal, but are 
in connexion with the oesophagus. It must be noted as a remark- 
able exception that in Synapta, according to the investigations of 
QUATREFAGES, a complete hermaphroditism prevails. The genital 
organs have the form of long strings, whose internal surface is beset 
with conical structures containing Spermatozoa, whilst the inner- 
most cavity is filled with a pulpy substance in which the eggs are 
found. These eggs, as they grow, are pressed against the conical 
structures and so fertilized ; and then the germ-spot, which was 
before visible, disappears. As the development of the eggs pro- 
ceeds, the testes which adhered to the inner wall of the string and 
surrounded the eggs, are so much compressed that they become 
atrophied and disappear. This periodical development is a very 
remarkable physiological phenomenon 1 . 

With the exception of some interesting observations of SARS 
little was known respecting the development of Echinoderms until 
the last few years. [To the distinguished and unremitted labours of 
MUELLER we are principally indebted for nearly complete informa- 
tion respecting the very curious and unexpected processes which 
occur in different species. Very remarkable differences are observed 
according as more or less of the development is effected within the 
body of the parent, or according to the locality where the embryo 
is deposited on leaving the egg, or according to the different modes 
in which it is destined to acquire its food. As a general rule it 
may be stated that in littoral species when the embryo escapes at 
an early period from the egg the series of metamorphoses is less 
numerous: but that in pelagic species, where the embryo has to 
seek its food by swimming on the surface, the necessity for provi- 
sional organs of a complicated nature renders the changes very

remarkable. Amongst the Ophiurce, Ophiolepis squamata is vivi- 
parous. The young, about ten in number, are developed between 
the integument and the wall of the stomach of the parent, in the 
inter-radial spaces, each in its own compartment, formed by mem- 
brane extended between the wall of the body and the stomach and 
suspended by a ligament attached near one of the angles of its disc. 
When fully formed it passes out by one of the genital fissures 1 .] 
In Eckinaster sanguinolentus the embryo according to the observa- 
tions of SARS 2 , on its escape from the egg is of an oval form and 
covered with cilia. Presently excrescences, club-shaped processes, 
arise at one extremity by which it adheres to the inferior surface of 
the disc of its parent, now converted by the infolding of the rays 
into a brooding cavity. When the arms begin to shoot forth these 
processes disappear, and feet or tentacles, few in number but pro- 
portionally very long, serve for the creeping and adhesion of the 
creature. The whole development occupies six or seven weeks. 
When the clavate processes are about to disappear they are near the 
edge of one of the inter-radial spaces of the disc of the Echinoderm. 
Of CamatulcB it had been discovered by THOMPSON 3 that during an 
early period of their life they are fixed to a stem and then resemble 
Pentaerini, in other words, that the form which in Pentacrini is 
permanent, is in them transitory. But their previous metamorphoses 
were unknown. [BusCH has observed these changes from the egg 
until the period when the embryo is about to be attached. The egg 
having passed from the parent by an aperture at the side of the 
pinnulce, remains attached to the pinnula by an abundant mucus, 
from spherical becoming oval, and the embryo may be seen rotating 
within the egg by means of its general covering of cilia. When the 
egg falls from the pinnula the embryo escapes : its oval form is 
elongated, the straight sides assume a gently undulating contour : on 
the tops of the undulations transverse bands of larger cilia are seen 
in place of the general ciliated covering : the bands are at first three 
in number, afterwards four, surrounding the body in parallel circles : 
the longitudinal axis of the body now becomes gently curved, and a 
mouth is seen on the concave surface : the bands of cilia disappear

and the creature having lost its apparatus for motion sinks to the 
bottom : tentacles in the meanwhile, five on each side of the mid- 
line, have been developed, and hooks are seen at the two extremities 
of the body which shew by their peculiar form that those extremities 
correspond to the ends of the arms : the embryo now cup-shaped 
from the increased convexity of its dorsal surface attaches itself to 
the bottom by this surface from which it secretes its pedicle. The 
absence of symmetry in the relation of the Echinoderm to its larva 
is indicated by the stern of the Echinoderm being placed at right 
angles to the axis of the larva, and the tentacles and mouth on the 
opposite surface 1 . 

In by far the greater number of Echinoderms the embryos pass 
gradually into forms which, however remarkably they may differ, 
are all laterally symmetrical. The axis becomes bent and on the 
ventral surface (that where the mouth opens) is a depression bounded 
above and below by transverse bands of cilia which are continuations 
of the lateral bands which bound the dorsal surface. They all have 
a complete digestive tube consisting of mouth, oesophagus, stomach, 
intestine and anus. This tube is placed in the median plane, the 
mouth in the ventral depression described above, and the tube 
curves from it to terminate beyond the transverse band of cilia 
above the mouth on the same ventral surface. Also they have all 
an aquiferous system, a tube terminating externally in a dorsal pore 
and internally in a sac. When MUELLER observed the singular 
forms of the larvae of Ophiurce, and Echini with their long processes 
supported by slender rods of carbonate of lime he named them 
Pluteus from their general resemblance to a painter's easel with his 
work upon it. In Asterice and Holothurice the larvae have a more 
flattened form, like a coat of arms witli its surrounding ornaments. 
The process of development in these different larval forms is two- 
fold. In the first case the body of the Echinoderm is formed by 
gemmation round the stomach of the larva, which continues to be 
its stomach, and when it is formed, all that remains of the larva, 
with the exception of certain structures in connexion with the aqui- 
ferous system is gradually ( Ophiura and Echinus) or simultaneously 
(Bipinnaria asteriyera} rejected. In the second case the symmetrical

larva with its bilateral ciliated band passes into the radial type, as 
in the larva of Comatula: it has a cylindrical form with five trans- 
verse bands of cilia. From this pupa-state the Echinoderm is 
developed without the rejection of any part of the pupa. It is either 
formed upon a part of the pupa, and the rest is absorbed by it 
( Tonnaria of certain Asterice) , or the entire pupa is simultaneously 
metamorphosed into the Echinoderm (Holothurice) . In both these 
cases, but especially the first, the axis of the Echinoderm does not 
coincide with the axis of the larva, but crosses it at a large angle. 
Caecal processes are formed round the stomach of the larva in con- 
nexion with the vesicle of its aquiferous system : they are the 
rudiments of the water-canal around the mouth of the Echinoderm 
and of the vessels which proceed to the tentacles and feet. Where 
the afferent water-tube meets the surface of the Echinoderm the 
madrepore-plate is formed, and the portion of the tube within the 
body of the Echinoderm becomes its stone- or lime-canal. In Ophiurce 
the madrepore-plate has been discovered by MUELLER*, its pores do 
not open externally being covered by a plate of the inferior surface 
of the disc. In Holothurice it is within the abdominal cavity, in 
Asterice on the dorsal surface, in Echini it coincides with one of the 
genital plates. In all these cases a tube, whether it be hardened 
by carbonate of lime (stone-canal) or not, runs from the madre- 
pore-sac or plate to the circular aquiferous canal surrounding the 
oesophagus.] 

The power of reproduction in Echinoderms is very great. Star- 
fishes are frequently seen with one or more small arms or rays, that 
have been formed anew in consequence of the loss of the parts. 
GUETTAKD and BERNARD DE JIJSSIEU confirmed the reproduction 
by many experiments 3 . In Holothurice even viscera may be lost 
and formed anew; and some species are propagated by spontaneous 
division 4 .

ECHINODERMS. 139 

The nervous system of Ecliinoderms was first described and 
figured by TIEDEMANN in Asterias aurantiaca (Astropecten) l . There 
is found around the mouth a nervous ring without ganglia, whence 
is given off a fine thread for each ray, and running along it. On each 
side of this thread is another, which descends into the cavity of the 
body. In sea-urchins also and in star-fishes, in which TIEDEMANN 
could only detect obscure traces of a nervous system, KROHN dis- 
covered a few years ago a distribution similar to that of Asterice. In 
Echinus the ring surrounds the mouth within the apparatus usually 
named Aristotle's Lantern (see below in the systematic arrange- 
ment) : in Holothuria in the calcareous ring to which the longitudinal 
muscles are attached. Five principal nervous stems run with the 
vessels that are in connexion with the ambulacral apparatus 2 . 

Little is known of special organs of sense in Echinoderms. In 
star-fishes EHRENBERG discovered at the point of the rays on the 
abdominal surface, a small red spot, surrounded by a ring of cal- 
careous tubercles, which he considers to be an eye. In specimens 
preserved in spirit the pigment disappears, and so the existence of 
the spots cannot be recognized. Moreover they are wanting in 
many species 3 . FORBES discovered five similar spots in sea-urchins, 
on the upper surface, situated upon as many pentagonal plates that 
alternate with five larger plates on which the oviducts open. Both 
in the star-fish and sea-urchin each of the five principal nerves runs 
as far as one of these spots and ends beneath it 4 . But in neither of 
these animals has a lenticular transparent body been discovered. 
The ambulacral tubes and the feelers around the mouth may, as 
highly sensitive parts, be ranked amongst the organs of touch. 

To the motive apparatus of Echinoderms belong the little feet 
or tentacles, already noticed, the ambulacral tubules by means of 
which the animals creep. They have muscular fibres on their walls. 
In Echinus VALENTIN found in them both transverse and longi- 
tudinal bundles, and radiating fibres in the suckers at their termina- 
tion. He conceives that the motions of the ambulacral tubes are

effected by means of these muscular fibres, and in no degree by 
forcing fluid into and out of them. To how great an extent these 
parts can be elongated may be judged by the length of the spines 
of the shell in sea-urchins : they must have the power of extending 
beyond the longest spines. In specimens that have been kept in 
spirits these tubules are found to be short and mutually entangled. 
The teeth, and the curious apparatus that encloses them (ARISTOTLE'S 
Lantern) have a number of proper muscles. As to the general 
muscular system, that which moves the whole body, it is found 
especially developed in Holotliurice. Here ten muscles run the whole 
length of the body, beneath the skin: they are arranged in pairs, 
which are separated by spaces in which transverse circular fibres are 
found that cover the entire inner surface of the skin. By means of 
the longitudinal muscles the body can be shortened and bent : by 
the transverse fibres it is contracted transversely, and so attenuated 
and elongated. The longitudinal muscles are inserted into a cal- 
careous ring composed of five large and five smaller pieces, and 
surrounding the commencement of the intestinal canal. 

All these animals inhabit the sea. They are found in all parts 
of the world : yet, most of the species only in limited regions. Since 
we have only a partial acquaintance with foreign species, many 
more of which will doubtless be hereafter discovered, we are not in 
a condition to give a survey of the geographical distribution of the 
genera. Unlimited confidence is not to be reposed in the accounts 
given by some writers of the localities in which the species are 
native. Of the Asterice nearly one-third of the known species are 
found in the East-Indian seas, one-fifth in the seas of Europe. Of 
Opliiurce, on the other hand, the European and African species 
are more numerous than the East-Indian. The western hemisphere 
has, on the whole, fewer star-fishes than the eastern : in America 
there are no species of Scytaster, as, for instance, of Culcita, Astro- 
gonium, Stellaster ; Echinaster, on the other hand, is peculiarly 
American. The species of Euryale are chiefly found in the Arctic 
and in the Indian seas. To the species which are very generally 
distributed belongs that which occurs on the coast of Holland, 
Asterias (Asteracanthion) rubens. The Red sea so rich in species of 
the class of Polyps, has only a comparatively small number of star- 
fishes, and, in this respect is much behind the Mediterranean, which 
is especially rich in species of Astropecten. The Baltic appears to be 



ECHIXODERMS. 141 

avoided by Star-fishes 1 . Of Sea-urchins about one-third of the 
known species are found in the East-Indian seas : here especially 
are found Cidarites and Scutella. Of Holothurice more species 
appear to be met with in the southern Pacific than in other seas. 
The western hemisphere is as much behind the eastern in respect 
of Echini and Holothurice as of Star-fishes.

SYSTEMATIC 
ARRANGEMENT OF ECHINODERMS. 



CLASS IV. 
ECHINODERMATA. 

ANIMALS with integument coriaceous, often calcareous; with 
distinct nutrient canal, freely suspended in an abdominal cavity. 
Organs of circulation and generation conspicuous ; sexes nearly 
always distinct. Disposition of the organs most frequently quinary, 
with body mostly radiate or globose, in some cylindrical. Distinct 
vestiges of a nervous system, a ring for the most part surrounding 
the mouth and sending off nerves radially. 

OEDER I. Pediculate Echinoderms. 

Tentacles numerous, membraneous, contractile, terminated by a 
suctorial disc, and issuing from minute apertures in the integument. 

Family I. Crino'idea. Integument calcareous (external skele- 
ton). Rays articulate, supplied with a central canal, absent in 
some. Mostly two apertures of the nutrient canal. 

The name Crindidea, given by MILLEK to this division of the ani- 
mal kingdom, is derived from Kpivov, a lily. At the beginning of the 
last century the name sea-lily, stone-lily was given to the Encrinus 
moniUformis, or liliiformis, a remarkable petrifaction of the Muschel- 
kalk. Most of them are set upon a stem ; the non-pediculate (Coma- 
tula LAM.) in the young state, according to the observations of 
THOMPSON, are also fixed to a pedicle. The non-pediculate species 
known to LINNAEUS were placed by him in the genus Asterias (Aste- 
rias pectinata, Ast. multiradiata) ; the pediculate species in the 



ECHINODERMATA. 143 

genus Isis, confounding the fossil Encrinus and the Pentacrinus 
caput Medusae of the existing creation under the name of Isis 
Asteria. This singular union of an Echinoderm with a genus of 
Polyps had doubtless an influence upon the later arrangement of 
LAMARCK, who placed Encrinus (see above, p. 80) amongst the sea- 
feathers. SCHWEIGGEB, and CUVIER restored it to the proper place, 
already assigned to it in the middle of the previous century by 
GUETTARD, who first described Pentacrinus caput Medusce. This 
whole family belongs rather to the former period of the history of 
our globe, than to the present. The species now living in our seas 
are almost all non-pediculate, whilst geological investigation has made 
us acquainted with numerous forms of pediculate sea-lilies. What is 
now a youthful mutable form of life was then the prevalent and 
permanent. The same thing may be observed in other classes also 
with respect to the fossil representatives of genera that are living 
at the present time. 

The chief work on this family is :

144 CLASS IV. 

Genera: Caryocrinites SAY, Platycrinites MILL., Actinocrinites 
MILL., Ehodocrinites MILL., Cyatlwcrinites MILL., Poteriocrinites 
MILL., Melocrinites GOLDP. 

For these fossil genera and others unnoticed we must for want 
of space refer to MILLER'S work already cited, to GOLDFUSS die 
Petrefacten Deutchlands, and other geological works. Comp. also

Curios. XIX. I. 1839, p. 329352, and L. v. BUCK on Caryocrinus 
ornatus in his work Ueber Cystideen, Berlin, 1845, 4to. 

In these and the following pediculate Crinoids, the cup-like part 
at the extremity of the stem and base of the arms is named Calyx. 
The bottom of this part, which is pentangular, and composed of five, 
four, or sometimes three plates, is named by MILLER pelvis ; JOH. 
MUELLER names the plates basalia; at the margin of these plates 
are the basal-pieces of the arms, forming the uppermost part of the 
calyx; there are two or three rows, and the uppermost bears the 
arms. MILLER gives to this part the name of scapula; the two 
pieces situated below are costce. JOH. MUELLER names these pieces 
radialia (radiale primum, r. secundum and r. axillare; his radiale 
axillare is the scapula of the English author). In those now 
named Crino'idea tesselata these parts are joined together without 
articulation. The fossil species of this division are found in the 
transition-limestone and the grey-wacke.

articulations of the arms that lie side by side, resembles an ear of Turkish 
wheat (Zea Mays) ; the joints of the stem, sometimes found in incredible 
numbers, changed into calcareous spar, are named Trochites 1 . 



1 QUENSTEDT (Ueber die EnTcriniten des Muschelkalks, WIEGMANN'S Archiv. 1835, TI - 
s. 223228, Taf. IV.) describes a species with different division of the arms, under the 



ECHINODERMATA. 145 

Pentacrinus MILLER. Column not incrassated towards the top, 
pentagonal with joints having a pentapetalous mark. Cirri adher- 
ing to the column in whorls. 

The fossil species of this genus belong to the oolite period, as

Ani. ed. illustr., Zooph. PI. 7, fig. 1, from the Lias-schist. 

The living species of this genus, Pentacrinus Caput Medusae, 
is found in the Caribbean Sea, and was first described by GUETTAED 
Mem. de TA cad. Roy. des Sc. 1755 (Paris, 1761) pp. 224, &c. PL 8 10 j 
another, more mutilated specimen, found on the coast of Barbadoes, 
was described by ELLIS in 1761, Phil. Transact, vol. 52, p. 357, PI. xm. 
Specimens of this species are rare in Museums, seven only, as far 
as is known, existing in the different Cabinets. The most complete 
description was given not long ago by J. MUELLER ( Ueber den Bau 
des Pentacrinus Caput Medusae, Berlin, 1843, folio). The stem of 
Pentacrinus has no muscles, but is merely passively motile or flexible 
by means of fibrous bundles and an elastic tissue between the joints. 
The arms and pinnulce are moveable by muscles without transverse 
stripes ; these muscles are situated on the side corresponding to the 
mouth, and can only flex the parts : extension, or motion outwards, 
seems to be effected merely by the elasticity of the parts. The 
growth of the joints of the stem occurs in the part at the top 
nearest to the calyx, which corresponds to what is observed in the 
growth of the joints in worms and entozoa.

According to the division of the arms the species of this tribe 
are arranged in three different genera by MUELLER and TROSCHELL. 
They are undivided in Asteronyx, divided dichotomously and only 
towards the end in Trichaster AGASS., divided from the base, first

dichotomously and afterwards into many branches, in Astrophyton 
LINCK. To the last division belongs :

Ophiura LAM. Arms five, undivided, serving for creeping, scu- 
tate, articulate. Disc plane, with two or four genital fissures in 
each interbrachial area on the ventral side. 

The name Ophiura, from acpis, serpent, and ovpd, tail, denotes very 
appropriately the form of the arms by which these Sea-stars are 
distinguished, and which are often so long as to exceed five or six 
times (nay in Ophiura longipeda even twenty times) the diameter 
of the disc. 

Sub-genera : Ophiocoma AGASS., Ophiolepis, Ophiarachna, Ophia-

Phalanx II. Asterice. Body depressed, angulate or stellate 
the angles being produced, with tentaculiferous furrows below, ex- 
tending as far as the point of the angles. Anus dorsal in most, 
surrounded by a mound of calcareous papillae. 

Asteria LAM. (Most are species from the genus Asterias L.) 

The Sea-stars. The form is very various, so that in some species 
the entire body seems to consist only of arms, ex. gr. in Ophidiaster, 
in others only of a pentagonal disc. But the arms are never 
sharply separate from the disc as in the Ophiurce, but are an 
immediate continuation of it. In most of the species there are five 
rays, however in these sometimes four or six occur as exceptions ; 
six arms as the normal number are found in Asterias gelatinosa, in 
Echinaster eridanella, six or seven in Asteriscus Diesingii, seven to 
nine in the sub-genus Luidia, eight to ten, mostly nine, in Solaster 
endeca, eleven to fourteen, generally twelve, in Solaster papposus, 
twelve or thirteen in Asterias aster, fifteen in Asteriscus rosaceus,

148 CLASS IV. 

fourteen to one-and-twenty in Echinaster Solaris; finally, in Asterias 
helianthus the rays are found up to thirty and more. The greater 
the number that any species possesses, the less is it constant. On the 
dorsal surface is placed a calcareous star-formed plate between two 
rays of the disc (verruca dorsi, tubercule madreporiforme, Madrepore- 
plate), which in Ophiura is wanting, and in Euryale lies on the 
oral surface. AGASSIZ who endeavours, with great acuteness, to prove 
a lateral symmetry in the Echinodermata, considers the ray that is 
opposite to this plate to be the first ray of the body. A tortuous 
tube proceeds from this dorsal plate downwards as far as the mouth, 
and is filled internally with a calcareous matter (see above, p. 130). 

This tube was named byTiEDEMANN (Anat. der Roehren-HolotJi., &c. 53, 
54) Stone-canal or Sand-canal; it terminates, becoming narrower, in the 
circular vessel surrounding the mouth and filled with watery fluid ; see 
above, p. 131. SIEBOLD has closely investigated the calcareous balk, 
consisting of several joints and internally hollow, which occupies this 
canal and described its complicated structure ; MUELLER'S Archiv. 1836, 
B. 291, &c. [Also SHARPEY, in TODD'S Cyclop, of Anat. and Phys. n. 
PP- 35> &c., describes in the interior of the jointed calcareous tube a lamina 
attached longitudinally, which passes inwardly a certain way and then 
separates into two which are rolled in opposite directions, something after 
the manner of the inferior turbinated bone of the ox.] 

The Sea-stars can bend their rays towards each other, which is 
serviceable in moving through narrow fissures arid between stones. 
They do not swim, but creep by means of their tentacles with 
mouth downwards. They feed principally upon Molluscs. Though 
the genus Asterias of LAMAKCK, by the exclusion of Comatula, 
Ophiura and Euryale, be much more narrowly limited than the 
same genus in the Systema Naturae, of LINNAEUS, still the species are 
too numerous and the forms too various not to be regarded rather 
as a natural group which ought to be divided into several genera 
or sub-genera. This has been done by LINCK, and more lately 
especially by AGASSIZ and MUELLER and TEOSCHELL, to whose works 
we refer. The primary division of the group by MUELLER and 
TROSCHELL is founded on the Tentacles, which in most of them are 
placed in two rows in every furrow, but in others in four rows.

The shell of these animals consists of an arrangement of plates 
having a pent- or hexangular form. They compose ten girdles, each 
made up of two rows of such plates. Five of the girdles, commonly 
narrower than the others, have two rows of small apertures and 
alternate with these. The rows of apertures are named ambulacra : 
they either entirely surround the periphery (ambulacra perfecta), or 
are found only on the uppermost part, resembling in their arrange- 
ment a star or five-petalled flower (ambulacra circumscripta). By 
these apertures the tentacles or ambulacral tubes are exserted, 
of which we have treated above. The Sea-Urchins effect their 
movements by means of these tubes 1 , they appear to have a 
great power of elongation, to be able to stretch farther than the 
extremities of the rigid spines, which in certain species are some 
inches in length. Around the anus are five larger apertures (in 
some genera only four) which are the outlets of the oviducts or 
efferent vessels ; they are situated in as many pentagonal calcareous 
plates, with the point directed outwards, of which one, larger than 
the rest and of a different structure, corresponds to the calcareous 
plate (madrepore-plate) of the Sea-stars, as BASTER had previously 



of Natural History vi. 1841, pp. 175 184, pp. 275 290. Want of space prevents 
our noticing the numerous generic names of GRAY ; some genera agree with those 
of MUELLER and TROSCHELL, of which a more detailed notice by AGASSIZ may 
be found in the preface to the second number of his Monoyraphies d'Echinodermes, 
pp. 5, 6. 

1 GANDOLPHE Quelles sont lesjambes des Oursins? Mem. de VAcad. des Sc. de Paris 
pour 1709, Histoire, p. 33. With his observations those of BASTER, TIEDEMANN and 
others completely agree ; AGASSIZ, who at one time considered the spines to be organs 
of motion, and doubted that such was the office of the ambulacral tubes, has since 
renounced that opinion.

observed 1 . Between these five genital plates, lie five smaller (the 
ocellar plates), also pentagonal but with the point turned inwards, so 
that the plates are wedged into the spaces between the points of 
the first five. There are still other smaller plates, variable in 
number, that lie within the ring formed by these ten, and immedi- 
ately surround the anus. 

The chemical composition of the calcareous shell is remarkable 
on account of the extremely small proportion of organic matter ; it 
consists almost entirely of carbonate of lime. The growth of the 
shell is effected by enlargement of the plates, and by addition to 
their number upwards ; hence younger individuals are flatter than 
older ones, and the form of itself alone becomes a deceptive criterion 
in determining species. 

The moveable spines, of which the number increases with the 
age, have at their base a small cavity, by which, as by an articular 
surface, they are connected with the tubercle of the shell. These 
tubercles are placed in rows, like the apertures of the ambulacra, 
and are found both on the ambulacral and on the interambulacral 
fields. 

The mouth is provided with five teeth, whose points are sharp 
and hard, and meet in a pentagon at the inferior aperture. These 
teeth are long rods, which become soft and transparent inwards. 
They perforate five triangular pyramids, which by their mutual 
arrangement form a conical apparatus with the broad base facing 
inwards, and to which base still other small calcareous pieces are 
united. This very complicated apparatus, with its provision of 
muscles, bears the singular name of ARISTOTLE'S lantern*. 

Sea-urchins cannot swim, but only creep along the bottom of the 
sea. There are species that sometimes live in cavities which they 
have formed in the rocks 3 . 

The food of the Sea-urchin consists, according to the microscopic 
investigation of the excretions in JEchinus lividus by VALENTIN,

principally, if not exclusively, of marine plants (Fuel, Confervce); 
according to others it would seem to live on Molluscs, but the 
fragments of shell, often found with considerable quantity of sand 
in the intestinal canal, may have been contained in the sea-water 
swallowed, and need not by any means to be looked on as the 
remains of shell-fish that had been consumed. 

Petrified shells of Sea-urchins are found in great numbers in 
secondary strata, particularly in the chalk-formation, the interior 
being usually filled with silicious earth.

Some species of this division are fossil, and occur especially 
in the chalk-formation, others in tertiary deposits. Amongst the 
species now living, which chiefly belong to the genus Brissus AGASS. 
we note : 

Spatang. ventricosus, RUMPH. Amb. Rariteitk. Tab. xiv. No. i ; this 
foreign species attains a very large size. To the proper genus Spatangus 
AGASS. belongs Spat, purpureus, BLAINV., Actinol. PI. xiv., FOKBES Brit. 
Starf. p. 182, in the North Sea and Mediterranean. The form is heart- 
shaped. Of this species MILNE EDWARDS has given an anatomical figure 
in CUVIEB R. Anim. 3d. illustree, Zoophytes, PI. xi. bis. See also some 
notices on the Anatomy of Spatangus in SCHWEIGGER'S Handb. der Natur- 
geschicJite der skelettl. ungeglied. Thiere, s. 538, 539. 

The mouth is in this genus without teeth. There are only four 
ovaria or testes present, as also only four pori genitales. PHILIPPI 
not long ago described three American species in which only three 
genital pores existed, and which he united under the name of 
Tripylus. See ERICHSON'S Archiv f. Naturgesch., 1845, s. 344,

20 species, of which 1 7 are from the Jura-formation and 3 from the chalk-

discovered belonging to the present animal world ; AGASSIZ places this 
genus in the following division, that of the Clypeastro'idea ; its place cannot 
be determined with precision, before it is known whether teeth be present ; 
still we are of opinion that it ought not to be separated from Ananchytes, 
but forms the transition between that genus and the following division.

Centurie Zoologique, Paris 1830, 8vo. 

We have spoken above (p. 140) of the calcareous ring which may 
be considered as a vestige of a skeleton, and which serves for the 
attachment of the longitudinal muscles. The pieces of which this 
ring consists are toothed above, but they do not discharge the office 
of teeth, the food, as far as it undergoes separation and mastication 
previous to deglutition, being thus effected by the callous skin 
surrounding the mouth alone. Holothurice feed upon conchifera and 
other marine animals ; TIEDEMANN frequently found shells entire and 
uninjured in the intestinal canal of Holothuria tubulosa, so that the 
molluscs appeared to have been dissolved in the shell and digested. 
The bits of shell and the other matters unfit for use and undigested 
are rejected from the cloaca with the water in expiration. We 
have indicated above the chief particulars respecting the internal 
structure. 

See, besides, TIEDEMANN 1. 1., also the beautiful engraving from a prepara- 
tion by HUNTER in Catalogue of the Physiolog. Series of Compar. Anat. 
contained in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, Vol. I. London, 
1833, PL m - PP- 250254. 

The numerous species of this family are separated according 
to the form of the Tentacles (LAMARCK, GRUBE), the position of the

feet or ambulacra! tubes (CuviEn), or the union of both these 
characters (BRANDT) into many genera. The arrangement of 
BRANDT is circumstantial, and here and there rather artificial than 
natural. Regard ought also to be had to the Habitus. If the 
position of the Tentacles be made the chief point in the arrange- 
ment, animals will be separated which in their habitus are nearly 
allied. These tentacles are either branched like a tree, fingered, or 
shield-like, (peltate), i. e. they consist of a pedicle with an expansion 
which is disciform, often indented or arborescent. Their number is 
usually ten, or twice ten. Where eight tentacles seem to be present, 
sometimes on closer inspection two others, smaller and undeveloped, 
are found, (the sub-genera Anaperus and Colochirus of TROSCHELL'). 
In some no special internal respiratory organs are found (the genus 
Oncilabes of BRANDT ; in most the arborescent respiratory organ 
exists which we described above in Holothuria tubulosa. 

Pentacta GOLDF. (Cladodactyla, Dactylota, Oncinolabes, Aspido-

on oval eminences of the skin, which are visible under the microscope alone. 
Other similar eminences are covered with cells which can evolve an 
extremely fine thread (nettle-organ ?). These animals appear to endure 
wounding and extreme mutilation without being destroyed.

very contractile and sometimes shortens itself one-half. Longitudinal and 
circular bundles of muscle, visible through the skin, give it a latticed 
appearance. The intestinal canal is very long, making two bends back- 
wards and forwards ; the last ascending portion is wound spirally round the 
preceding piece. Two brown vesicles, connected with the propagation, 
terminate with fine apertures before and by the side of the anus. The 
nervous system presents two rings round the oesophagus, and a cord 
running on the abdominal surface, that gives off numerous branches, and is 
surrounded by a blood-vessel as by an envelope ; see KROHN in MUELLER'S

FORBES gives the name of Syrinx to the species which have a short 
proboscis with an indented tentacular fold around the mouth, like Sipunc. 
nudus. In other species the proboscis is longer, and there is a ring of 
simple lancet-shaped tentacles round the mouth. Of these he forms his 
genus Sipunculus, which appears to agree with Phascolosoma LEUCK.

CLASS V. 
INTESTINAL WORMS (ENTOZOA) 1 . 

BY Intestinal Worms are understood worms that live in other ani- 
mals, (not necessarily in their viscera) . Though not more correctly 
in point of language, they might, perhaps, be better named Internal 
Worms, which would be a literal translation of the word Entozoa. 
This class is by no means natural, for the animals included in it not 
only differ remarkably from each other in external form, but also 
in internal structure. The efforts that have been made hitherto to dis- 
tribute the different orders and families of the Entozoa amongst the 
different classes of invertebrate animals have not been satisfactory. 
In this, as in so many other attempts to determine the affinities of 
animals, a certain external resemblance has been mistaken for 
correspondence of internal structure and of type of organisation, by 
which alone true affinities can be established. An unprejudiced 
inquirer will scarcely attach more value to a comparison of EcMno- 
rhynchua with Sipunculus, of Cysticercus with v bladder-bearing 
Acalephs, &c. than to a comparison of bats with birds. Consequently 
we are compelled to retain the class Entozoa, however we acknow-

ledge it to be unnatural. RUDOLFIII, to whose investigation this 
part of Zoology is so greatly indebted, compares tlie class of the 
intestinal worms to a Fauna, a collection of animals that live in a 
certain region. Their country is the living body of other animals. 
Recent observations have, however, taught us that some species in 
the cycle of their developments, leave their country for a time. The 
radial type, which we observed in the former classes, particularly 
.in the Polyps and Acalephs, is here wanting. All Entozoa approxi- 
mate to the elongated form of the articulate worms, although in 
some of them that form, on account of a bladder to which they are 
affixed by their extremity, is not at first sight apparent. Special 
respiratory organs are wanting. Some are entirely without sex, 
and are propagated by gemmation ; others are bisexual ; in others 
the sexes are distinct. 

We must premise something as to the division of the Entozoa. 
KUDOLPHI adopts five principal sections, which had been already 
distinguished by GOETZE and ZEDER before his time. The first is 
that of Cystic worms (Cystica from KVO-TIS, a bladder). The body is 
compressed or cylindrical, the posterior part of it passing into a 
bladder ; sometimes many such entozoa are fixed on one bladder. 
The head has suckers, a circlet of hooks, or four proboscides armed 
with hooks. No genital organs have been discovered; nor any 
intestinal canal. [These have been shewn to be imperfectly deve- 
loped Teenies.'] The second division contains the Tape-worms 
(Cesto'idea, from KCO-TOS, a girdle, a band, eldos, form). They have an 
elongated, compressed or flat body that is mostly jointed. The head 
has suckers ; all the individuals are bisexual ; an intestinal canal is 
wanting. The third division is formed by the Suctorial Worms 
(Trematodes, r/j^/iaroJS?/?, perforate). The body is soft, compressed 
or roundish, and provided with one or more suctorial pores. The 
intestinal canal has in general only one opening, and is usually 
branched ; it lies in the tissue (parenchyma) of the body, not in a 
free space. The genital organs of both sexes are united in the 
same individual. The fourth division is that of the Thorn-headed 
Worms (Acanthocephala, from a*ai/0a, a thorn, and ^$0X77, head) ; 
they have a cylindrical, pouch-shaped body. The sexes are 
distinct ; an intestinal canal is wanting. The fifth division includes 
those intestinal worms which have an intestinal canal, with both 
mouth and anus, suspended freely in the cavity of the body. The 



INTESTINAL WORMS. 165 

body is cylindrical. The sexes are distinct. They are named Thread- 
worms or Round-worms (Nemato'idea, from vrjp.a, a thread, and eiSos). 
CUVIER makes a distinct order of this division, that of Intestinaux 
cavitaires / all the remaining entozoa he unites in a second order 
under the name of Intestinaux parenchymateux. OWEN has denoted 
these two principal divisions of CUVIER by the names Sterelmintha 
and Ccelelmintha 1 . In our compressed description of the structure 
of the intestinal worms we shall avail ourselves of the names 
which we have explained. 

In the cystic worms, the tape and thorn-headed worms, there 
is neither mouth nor intestinal canal; the nutriment is introduced 
by absorption of the skin. In the thorn-headed worms two parts 
are met with by the side of the sheath of the proboscis, usually of 
a flattened form, and very small anteriorly. These parts, called 
Lemnisci, are, according to EUDOLPHI, subservient to nutrition. 
They contain, according to the description of VON SIEBOLD, a finely 
granular parenchyma, and are very vascular. 

In the suctorial worms the intestinal canal commences with 
an oesophagus, more or less long, which, at its fore part (pharynx] 
is surrounded by muscular walls. In those that have a sucker at 
the anterior extremity of the body, the oral aperture is situated at 
its bottom. The intestinal canal divides, below the oesophagus, into 
two branches, which have csecal terminations backwards. In many 
species these branches do not subdivide 2 ; frequently they expand at 
their termination. In other species these principal branches give off 
other branches. This is especially the case in the Liver-fluke of 
sheep (Distoma hepaticum), where the branches divide to such a de- 
gree that the whole canal has an arborescent appearance. The oral 
aperture performs also the office of anus / at least the Distomes, 
which are taken alive from the liver, and exposed to air or placed 
in water, reject by the mouth, entirely or in part, the brown fluid 
with which the intestinal canal was filled 3 . The genus Pentastoma 
or Linguatula, differs from all the other suctorial worms in the

structure of its intestinal canal as well as in other respects. On that 
account CUVIER and OWEN have with propriety removed it from this 
division in which RUDOLPHI placed it. The intestinal canal lies in 
a free cavity of the body, though covered by the coils of the oviduct, 
and ends with a distinct anus l . The position and form of the canal 
agrees with the same in the Round-worms; only in the oesophagus 
is there some difference, since this tube in the Nemato'idea runs 
from the mouth at the anterior extremity of the body backwards in 
the same plane with the intestinal canal, whilst in Pentastoma it 
ascends obliquely because the mouth is situated on the abdominal 
surface. In the Nemato'idea the oesophagus is muscular, and in 
many species wider at its termination. The intestinal canal that 
succeeds it is straight, and its whole course continues nearly of the 
same width. In Ascaris lumbrico'ides pedunculated pyriform vesicles 
are found, which adhere to the internal surface of the integument, 
and occupy the space between the skin and the intestinal canal. 

A vascular system has been discovered in many entozoa. 
[Amongst the Nemato'idea BLANCH ARD has described in Ascaris 
megalocepliala CLOQUET two longitudinal vessels lodged in each of 
the lateral canals within the integument, which extend from one 
extremity of the body to the other. At about the depth of one 
third of the oesophagus, the two, supposed to be arteries, leave their 
tubes to form an arch behind the oesophagus ; on the arch a small 
ampulla is seen which is supposed to supply the office of a heart. 
The two arteries descend in the tubes throughout the whole length 
of the body, and communicate with the two other longitudinal 
vessels supposed to be veins 2 . In the tcenia the longitudinal canals, 
four or six in number, communicate by transverse branches, and 
open in the last joint into a pulsatile vesicle, which expels their 
contents in drops at intervals. In the suctorial worms the fine 
vascular network, hitherto considered to be a circulating system, 
has been shewn by VAN BENEDEN to be an appendage of the 
tubular system, which terminates in a vesicle that opens externally 
by & foramen caudale. The apparatus in the last two families of

worms appears to be similar, and for the purpose of secretion; a 
renal secretion, as VAN BENEDEN supposes *.] In the thorn-headed 
worms there are two lateral canals situated beneath the skin that 
run the whole length of the body. 

We have already remarked that special respiratory organs are 
wanting. So far as any action occurs between the air of the 
medium in which these animals live and their nutrient fluid, it must 
be effected by means of the skin. But Entozoa live, for the most 
part, in situations where the atmosphere exists in a condition very 
impure and unfit for respiration ; or where no air at all can enter, 
as in the liver, brain, kidney, &c. It is therefore probable that 
they derive from the fluids absorbed from the animals in which they 
live, the quantity of oxygen necessary for their life, and that they 
experience the influence of this gas only mediately through the 
animals in which they live 2 . 

With respect to propagation: no genital organs, as noticed 
above, have been detected in Cystic worms. What many writers 
have described as eggs in these worms are calcareous corpuscles 
beneath the skin, which also occur in Tape-worms. Their multi- 
plication is effected by gemmation. In Ccenurus there arise on the 
bladder on which the worm, or that extremity of it that bears 
the head, is seated, little buds which again develop other buds; in 
Echinococcus new bladders are formed within the parent bladder, 
like cells within cells, in which young Echinococci are developed 
that continue hanging by a thread for a time, after the containing 
envelope is ruptured, and then fall into the cavity of the parent 
bladder 3 . In Cysticercus the mode of propagation is yet unknown. 
In Trematoda there is found on the abdominal surface, generally 
nearer to the anterior than the posterior extremity, an opening 
common to the organs of both sexes. From this a penis, usually 
named Cirrus*, can be evolved; near this part the vagina opens.

168 CLASS V. 

The testes have mostly a rounded form ; in Amphistoma subtrique- 
trum and giganteum, they are finger-shaped and branched 1 . From 
these testes, usually two in number, efferent vessels proceed to a 
seminal vesicle lying at the base of the penis in the Cirrus-sac 
(receptaculum Penis) ; from which a canal arises that runs to the penis. 
But besides this, one of the testes gives still a third vas deferens to 
a seminal vesicle lying further behind (vesicula seminalis interior), 
and from which arises a short tube connected with the oviduct 2 . 
Here self-impregnation may be effected : in which case the second 
vesicula seminalis and the external genital organs are difficult of 
explanation : unless we suppose that both self-impregnation and 
copulation are possible. In the female organs of the suctorial worms 
we would direct particular attention to that remarkable arrangement 
by which, according to V. SIEBOLD, the yolk and the germ (vesicula 
germinativa] are not produced in the same organ: that here we 
must consequently, instead of ovary, distinguish a germ-stock and a 
yolk-stock. The lateral parts, usually dendritic or botruoidal, which 
were formerly believed to be ovaries, are the yolk-stocks : the germ- 
stock is placed in the middle of the body, and has a roundish form. 
In the Tape-worms the two sexes are also united : and Y. SIEBOLD 
suspects that in this case, also, the germ and yolk-stocks are dis- 
tinct organs. In the jointed Tape- worms (Tcenia, Bothriocephalus) 
the sexual organs are situated in every joint, only the anterior more 
recent joints do not yet indicate them, because they become more 
perfectly developed in proportion as the joints are more posterior. 
These animals, therefore, during their growth present us with a 
successive repetition of the same organisation. Some authors think 
that every individual joint is to be considered as a suctorial worm, 
and the Tape-worm as a compound suctorial worm. The sexual 
openings are situated in every joint, either on the edge or in the 
middle. In Bothriocephalus latus, for instance, on the abdominal 
surface of the body there is a fold of skin in the middle of each

2 V. SIEBOLD found this arrangement in many species of Distoma, and suspects that 
it occurs in all. See BURMEISTER on Disloma gloliporum in WIEGM. Archiv. i. 1835,

joint, yet nearer the anterior edge, with two openings : through the 
anterior and larger the penis is evolved; the posterior smaller 
is the female sexual opening: round both of them are minute 
white points which EscHRiCHT 1 concluded, under high powers of 
the microscope, to be follicles (mucous crypts of the skin). The 
eggs of BotJiriocephalus have a hard shell, as in the Distomes, of a 
brown or brownish-yellow colour, and seem like them to spring 
open with a sort of hood. In the thorn-headed and round-worms 
the sexes are distinct, and may be often recognised externally 
by their different form and size. In the thorn-headed worms the 
sexual organs fill the greater part of the cavity of the body. From 
the sheath that surrounds the proboscis there runs backward in the 
axis of the body a band-like structure, which has been erroneously 
supposed to be a canal, but which is for the support of the organs 
that prepare the germ or the seed (ligamentum suspensorium) ; VON 
SIEBOLD supposes that even the ovaries are developed in this organ. 
These ovaries are found free in the abdominal cavity, as masses of 
oblong-round eggs : the eggs become detached as they advance in 
development. The muscular oviduct terminates in a very small 
opening, scarcely visible at the posterior part of the body : it has at 
its anterior extremity an infundibular expansion which alternately 
widens and contracts, and takes up the eggs that were floating freely 
in the cavity of the body and moves them onwards 2 to the oviduct. 
This arrangement, in virtue of which the oviduct opens freely into 
the cavity of the abdomen and is not an immediate continuation of 
the ovary, is found in most vertebrates, with the exception of the 
osseous Fishes, but has not hitherto been observed in invertebrates 
except in EchinorJiynchus. In male thorn-headed worms there are 
usually two testes lying one behind the other. The penis lies in a 
sac having a conical appendage that can be everted from the body 
in the form of a little bell. 

Amongst the Thread-worms the males are less frequent than the 
females : they are smaller and more slender, and may frequently be

recognised by their curved extremity or by the sexual organ exter- 
nally visible ; this penis is in most species double, in Tricocephalus 
and Trichosoma single. The organ which prepares the germ or 
seed has the form of a slender convoluted canal. It is single in the 
males : in the females, with few exceptions, it is double. These 
canals are of great length : according to CLOQUET, in the male 
Ascaris lumbrico'ides when quite unravelled it measures from 2^ 3 
feet, and in the female each of them measures 4 5 feet. The dif- 
ferent divisions of the canal may be considered to be ovary or testis, 
and vas deferens or oviduct with uterus. The terminal portion in 
the female is distinguished as uterus by its greater circumference 
and its vigorous peristaltic motion. A very wide, longish sac- 
shaped structure at the termination of the canal in the male is to be 
considered as vesicula seminalis. The external sexual opening is, in 
the male, always situated at the posterior extremity of the body ; 
in the female ordinarily further forward, and in some species in the 
middle, or towards the anterior extremity 1 . Non-sexual Nematoi'ds 
are met with 2 ; CREPLIN gives it as a general rule that a Nematoid 
living in a perfectly closed cyst, or shut up on every side by a mem- 
brane, never has sexual organs. It has been suspected that these 
species are in an incomplete state, and can attain their perfect deve- 
lopment only in other localities 3 . 

We here approach what, until very recently, was one of the 
most obscure problems in the economy of the Entozoa : and 
MIESCHER was fully justified in his remark that many of the 
observations relating to their development are riddles of Natural 
History 4 . [With respect to the suctorial worms our information is 
in fact only fragmentary : yet since the observations refer to very 
different periods of their development in different Trematodes, we 
are able from analogy to collect a tolerably connected history of the 
whole process in any one of the class.] It is well known that the

INTESTINAL WOKMS. 171 

Danish zoologist MUELLER classed amongst his Infusories minute 
worms with tails, to which he gave the generic name of Cercaria. 
The accurate observations of NITZSCH taught us to define the genus 
more completely, and supplied a lively picture of the form and 
movements of a worm that to the naked eye seems like a moving 
point 1 . He compared these animals to Distomes that have had a 
tail-like appendage attached to them, and their motions to those of 
a Vibrio: each of these structures, the body and the tail, had a 
separate motion : when the body moved on by creeping and sucking 
the tail was at rest; and, conversely, when the tail undulated rapidly 
it forced along with it the body, which seemed now to have no 
independent motion of its own. NITZSCH further saw that Cercarice 
cast their tail, and observed in Cercaria ephemera that it fixes 
itself, covers itself with a shell that presently hardens, and thus 
becomes, as it were, a pupa. Such pupae remain unchanged for 
months: what was to succeed remained unknown. Afterwards 
similar observations were made by others, particularly by VON 
SIEBOLD. STEENSTRUP* shewed that the pupae change into Di- 
stomes after the lapse of several months. Cercarice live as parasites 
within the bodies of different Molluscs, as Lymnceus and Planorbis. 
But this does not terminate the surprising series of these changes. 
Cercarice, the larvae of Distomes, do not arise immediately from the 
eggs of these last. Within the above-named Molluscs, and in some 
others, little bags of an oblong form (germ-pouches) are found, in 
which a peculiar organisation and motion may sometimes be traced, 
but which in other species are motionless, and contain Cercarice in 
a more or less advanced state of development. Considered as para- 
sites of the germ-pouches, these have been named parasites of the 
second order: yet they are not parasites, but the progeny of these 
vermiform germ-pouches 3 . How these last originate from the young 
of Distomes has not been absolutely ascertained. The young animals,

that proceed from eggs of Distomes, move rapidly by means of 
cilia with which their body is covered like that of many Infusories. 
In such a young animal VON SlEBLOD saw in Monostoma mutabile 
a parasite lodged which agreed in form with that of the germ-pouch 
of Gercaria echinata. [He concludes that the germ-pouch is thus 
shewn to be the descendant of a Trematode. The Monostoma muta- 
bile is a parasite of water-birds and lives in cavities of their body 
which communicate with the external world. If a Monostoma mut. 
has produced an embryo, this can readily escape from the abode of 
its parent into the water, and may by means of its cilia find in- 
stinctively the animal suited to supply a fit residence for the further 
development of the germ-sac which it contains. It may pass into 
the interior of that animal by some one of the natural openings. 
Having now fulfilled its office of a living envelope to the germ- 
pouch, the ciliated embryo will die, and the germ-pouch seeks by 
perforation that situation within the body of its host which is suited 
to its further growth, and to the supply of due nutriment for the 
Cercaria-brood which it contains. The greater number of suctorial 
worms are, when they have gained their sexual organs, parasites of 
the higher vertebrates. How then can Cercaria effect an entrance 
into the body of such vertebrates as never come near the waters in 
which they live? VON SIEBOLD has given a probable answer to 
this enigma. He very commonly found in the aquatic larvse of 
EpJiemeridce, PhryganidcB, Libellulidce, &c., as well as in the perfect 
insects, encysted Cercarice which had divested themselves of their 
tail, and which in fact were larval trematodes. In order to effect a 
passive migration into the vertebrate in which their development is 
to be completed, they must wait until their temporary host is 
swallowed by some insectivorous land bird or mammal 1 .] Though 
there still remains an ample field for conjecture and fancy, thus 
much may be concluded from the observations hitherto made, that 
in these animals (as in Medusae, vid. pp. 100, 101) a succession of 
alternate generations occurs : that the first series does not resemble 
the parent, but that from it young ones proceed which return to the 
original form. The germ-pouches constitute the first series, the 
nurses (nutrices) / they are the starting-point of animals to be born as

larvaB, Cercarice, from the larval state to be changed into pupae, and 
from this finally to become Distomes 1 . 

Besides these changes of Distomes, of which the entire series, in 
its chief features at least, has been investigated, there are others 
relating to Tcenice which [until lately] were only observed frag- 
mentarily. Such was that of LEBLOND, who found in the peritoneum 
of Murcena conger a worm enclosed in a cyst and containing a 
young Tetmrhynchus. He described this larva of Tetrarhynchus as a 
species of Amphistoma and the Tetrarhynchus as its parasite 2 . MlES- 
c HER also made similar observations. Sometimes the successions of 
development appear to be possible only on change of abode. The 
simple Ligulce of fishes are found, according to KUDOLPHI, in birds 
that feed on fishes in their more perfect form and furnished with 
developed sexual organs : the worms of the [supposed] genus 
Scolex, that live in Pleuronectce, are probably changed in the bodies 
of Kays and Sharks into Bothriocephali, and the Bothriocephalus 
solidus, that lives in Gasterosteus pungitius, is changed, according to 
ABILDGARD S and CREPLIN, into the Bothriocephalus nodosus of water- 
birds (Mergus, Colymbus, &c.), which feed on that fish. That worms 
should thus continue to live in other animals becomes less surprising 
when we consider their tenaciousness of life; Ligulce have been 
found alive in under-cooked fish ; RUDOLPHI found individuals of 
Ascaris speculigera stiff and hard in the gullet and stomach of a 
Cormorant that had been kept for eleven days in spirit of wine 
which returned to life in warm water : and MIRAM saw individuals 
of Ascaris acus from the Pike dry and sticking to a board revived 
by water, and in some instances moving a part which had imbibed 
the fluid whilst the rest continued shrivelled up and adhering im- 
moveably to the board 4 . 

These observations prove, by the way, that it is not necessary 
to have recourse to equivocal generation in all cases of Entozoa 
where their existence appears to be inexplicable by the ordinary 
mode of propagation.

organs only in the intestinal canal of vertebrate animals: when 
found in other viscera of these animals, or in the interior of inferior 
creatures, they are always immature. The ova, however, of Tape- 
worms are never developed in the intestine of the animals which 
harbour the parent worm: still the embryo is so far advanced within 
the ovum contained in mature joints when discharged from the 
intestine that its form may be distinguished. In all instances the 
armature of the embryo is the same, however different it may be in 
the heads of fully developed worms of different species. Thus the 
embryos of Tcenia and of Bothriocephalus have both of them six 
booklets, though the head of a developed Tcenia is armed with a 
coronet of numerous booklets and that of Bothriocephalus is unarmed. 
These six booklets are not all of the same form : the pair in the 
middle are not curved at the extremity like the others, they are 
straight, very finely pointed, thinner throughout and also longer 
than the other four, which are also disposed in pairs. The middle 
pair are for penetrating soft tissues, and the rest for helping the 
embryo forward when it has once penetrated them. STEIN * saw 
these embryos free within the intestinal canal of larvae of Tenrbrio 
molitor and encysted on the outside of the canal, and justly con- 
cluded that the latter had perforated the canal from the interior, 
having entered by the mouth. The future tape- worm does not 
appear to arise from the embryo by metamorphosis, but to be formed 
within it by gemmation, whilst the six teeth of the embryo are 
rejected when they have performed their office and are found 
dispersed on its outer surface. A bud is seen within the embryo, 
which gradually assumes the special form of the head and neck of 
the future Tape-worm. As the development proceeds the head and 
neck would be permanently enclosed within the embryo in which it 
is being formed, were it not that at the same time a canal from the 
exterior is formed around them, so far as to allow the head and 
neck to be produced when the larva is freed from its cyst. It is 
then found that the neck of the larva is continuous with the body 
of the embryo, which forms a vesicle at its extremity. To this larva 
of a Tcenia the name of 8coUx, proposed by VAN BENEDEN, is now 
appropriated by the common consent of Helminthologists. If now

the Scolex can gain a passive migration into the intestinal canal of 
an animal suitable for its development, that development will 
proceed; the vesicle will be cast off: joints will be formed suc- 
cessively beneath the neck, and in these joints the genital organs 
will be developed, the joints first formed, or nearest the posterior 
extremity of the body, being the first to become mature. Thus the 
Scolex is changed into a Tape-worm. Many naturalists now con- 
sider the Tasnia3 to be compound animals, (which indeed was the 
opinion long ago of VALISNIERI and COULET and afterwards of 
BLUMENBACH,) colonies, like certain Polyps: the head and neck 
corresponding to the Polyp-stock, and the joints, under the name of 
Proglottis, to the single Polyps. By such observations as these 
VON SIEBOLD has been enabled to interpret justly those of LEBLOND 
and MIESCHER alluded to above. The Amphistoma of LEBLOND 
was the embryo of the Tape-worm, now the receptaculum Scolecis, 
the TetrarhyncJius the Scolex of a RJiyncotothrius. When the 
minuteness of these embryos is considered (they are not more in 
volume than the blood-disc of the frog) it is not difficult, as VAN 
BENEDEN * says, to comprehend that they may perforate the walls of 
the intestine to encyst themselves beneath the peritoneum, or to 
penetrate the vessels and distribute themselves with the blood in 
different viscera of the body, not excepting the brain itself, or the 
humours of the eye. Dr HAUBNER of Dresden caused six young 
lambs to swallow the living and mature joints of Tcenia serrata. 
They all died of the peculiar vertiginous disease produced by 
Ccenurus cerebralis. The Ccenurus vesicles were found in the brain, 
and the heart, lungs, and voluntary muscles abounded with encysted 
broods of Tcenia 2 . It would seem from this that the different forms 
of Ccenurus and Cysticercus assumed by the larva depend upon the 
locality occupied by the embryos, and the quantity and nature of 
the nutriment which they obtain there. And this conclusion is 
confirmed by the previous and converse experiments of VON SIE- 
BOLD. On causing young dogs to swallow Cystic, pisiformis from 
the liver of the hare, Cist, tenuicolles from the mesentery of the 
sheep, Cist, cellulosa from the muscles of the swine, Ccenurus cere- 
bralis from the brain of the sheep, the same form of Tcenia, viz.

Tcenia serrata, which in its developed state resides in the small 
intestine of the dog, was found in all cases. The experiments were 
performed so frequently, and with such precautions as to render the 
results incontestable 1 . The cyst is a secretion of the infested animal, 
and derives its blood-vessels from it. 

There is reason to conclude that a nervous system exists in 
most Entozoa. In Bothriocephalus BLANCHAHD describes a small 
ganglion on each side of the head (probably connected by a trans- 
verse band) , which sends a fine thread forwards and backwards ; but 
he was not able to detect the distribution of these 2 .] No nerves 
have been discovered in the incomplete cystic forms. In Distomes, 
and various other suctorial worms, two small ganglia have been 
seen near the mouth, which are united by a transverse band that 
runs over the oesophagus. From these two threads arise that have 
a parallel course through the body, become finer backwards, and 
give off some lateral branches 3 . In the thorn-headed worms there 
is, according to the investigations of VON SIEBOLD, in different 
species of Echinorhynchus, a nervous mass at the base of the pro- 
boscis, from whence threads radiate in all directions, whose course 
is not easy to follow. In Pentastoma a large nervous ganglion lies 
beneath the oesophagus, from which a nervous ring arises that runs 
transversely above the oesophagus; small branches go from the 
ganglion to the muscles of the mouth and the surrounding parts, 
and two threads proceed longitudinally, one on each side, back- 
wards, giving off fine branches, and, at last, losing themselves in 
the muscular tissue 4 . In Strongylus gigas the nervous system forms 
a flattened ring round the commencement of the oesophagus, and a 
string running backwards in the middle of the abdominal surface, 
which ends in a ganglion close by the anus. From the string arise 
at short and nearly equal distances transverse nervous threads. 
Special organs of sense are not found in the intestinal worms, with

the exception of those of touch about the mouth in certain thread 
and suctorial worms, such as threads, papillae, or tentacles, which 
can be extended by eversion. 

A special muscular system is usually present, but the muscular 
fibres are not always united into bundles to form distinct muscles. 
In the suctorial worms the muscular fibres in their entire course are 
completely united and interwoven with the rest of the mass of the 
body 1 . In the tape-worms fibres are visible beneath the skin 
running longitudinally. In the thread and thornheaded-worms two 
layers of muscular fibres may be distinguished beneath the skin, 
the one longitudinal, the other transverse. The proboscis of Echi- 
norhynchus has special muscles for its inversion and production. 

The Trematodes make use of their suckers, especially the pos- 
terior, for fixing themselves. Other intestinal worms have spines 
or hooks for that purpose, which are movable, and often possess 
considerable hardness. It is probable that these hooks cause by 
their irritation an increased afflux of fluids, whereby the nutrition 
of the worm within the animal that harbours it is facilitated. 

Entozoa are inhabitants of very different classes of animals; the 
most numerous are the species which occur in birds and fishes. 
Amongst the tape-worms especially are genera, which are found 
exclusively or principally in fishes ; nearly all the species of the 
genus Bothriocephalus occur in fishes; of Tcenia, on the other 
hand, more than half the numerous species occur in birds, very 
many in mammals, in fishes very few. Of the genera Distoma and 
EcMnorhynchus so rich in species, by far the most of these are found 
in fishes and birds. The genus Cysticercus appears to occur almost 
exclusively in mammals, as also Echinococcus and Ccenurus. Of 
the genus Ascaris all the classes of Vertebrates have many species; 
of Strongylus especially the mammals. The four genera, Distoma, 
Tcenia, Ascaris and Echinorhynchus, contain the greatest number of 
the known species of intestinal worms, especially the three first. 
Entozoa live in all parts of the body, but mostly on mucous mem- 
branes, in the intestinal canal and the lungs. Even in the heart 
and the blood-vessels some species occur.

just as a multiplication of individuals takes place in Nals by growth. The 
transverse partition commences before the genital organs are developed. 
The young animals consist of a head and a small number only of joints. 
Probably each animal performs annually a determinate circuit of develop- 
ment. When it has cast off its joints mature and full of eggs in the 
summer or autumn, new joints begin to grow ; in winter no eggs are found, 
and even occasionally in large individuals no developed genitals. Probably 
a similar renewal of the animal occurs also in Bothriocephalus lotus (and in 
Tcenia), when the new joints are developed in the part that succeeds the 
head, the so-called neck, which becomes marked off in joints. In this 
way may be explained what ESCHRICHT observed in a sufferer from JBothr. 
lotus, that amongst the pieces cast off, the subsequent piece did not fit on 
to that which had preceded, but on the contrary was similar to it ; narrower 
and more imperfect joints had in the meantime been developed into broader.

French name ver solitaire indicates. This species lives in the small 
intestine, and is in Holland, Germany, and England, the ordinary and 
perhaps the only species of this family which occurs in the human body. 
Only very few cases are known where a person had both a Tcenia solium 
and a BoihriocepJialus lotus 1 . These two tape-worms are distinguished not 
by the head alone, but also by the greater or less breadth of the body. In 
Tcenia, solium the middlemost joints are longer than they are broad ; 
in Bothriocephalus lotus the joints throughout the entire body have more 
breadth than length, and in the middle of each joint are two apertures of 
which the anterior is the larger and more readily perceptible ; from it the 
penis occasionally hangs everted ; in Tcenia solium the apertures are at the 
edge of the joints and alternate irregularly, i. e. they are situated sometimes 
on the left, sometimes on the right side, without determinate order of 
succession (foramina marginalia vag& aUerna). Since these worms are 
often rejected in fragments alone, the knowledge of these characters is for 
the Physician not without interest.

For the arrangement of the numerous species of this genus, RUDOLPHI 
availed himself also of the character of the booklets on the head, and 
distinguished inermes and armatce. But since this character is inconstant, 
and many of the inermes of RUDOLPHI have booklets in the younger period 
of their life, it cannot be recommended for this purpose. Among the 
species occurring in our domestic animals Tcenia plicata RUD., Tcenia 
magna ABILDG., Zool. dan. Tab. 1 10, fig. i, BREMSER, Icon. Helm. Tab. xv. 
fig. i, deserves to be recorded for the great size of its tetragonal head, which 
surpasses that of all other species. It lives in the small intestine of the 
horse.

larval forms of Tcenice, usually encysted in situations unfitted for 
their further development, and in which they become distended 
with fluid. But from the great interest that attaches to them on 
account of their occurrence in the human body as well as in that of 
other vertebrates, we subjoin the description of them, with a

The Vertigo of sheep (le tournis, das Drehen) is a consequence of these 
worms ; the symptoms vary according to the situation occupied by the 
worms ; the general characters of the disease are, that the sheep at first are 
somnolent, then fall into convulsions, run up and down and die of exhaus- 
tion. The vesicles, filled with water, by their expansion compress the 
brain and distend the ventricles, and this sometimes to such an extent, that 
the bones of the skull are affected and become extremely thin.

[Note. The different species of Tetrarhynchiia are, according to 
V. SIEBOLD, nothing else than imperfect and sexless forms of tape- 
worms, which in the perfect and developed condition belong to the 
genus Rhyncobothrius of RUDOLPHI. These last are found only in 
the intestinal canal of Rays and Sharks. The embryos of Rhynco- 
botkrii make use of the bodies of other marine animals on which 
Kays and Sharks feed, as a temporary residence, until they attain 
to the intestinal canal of the latter by being swallowed together 
with their host. Such animals are Flat-fish, the Turbot, Barbel, 
Haddock, Gurnard, Conger-eel, Sepia ; in all of which young Tetra- 
rhynchi have been found. That in such situations they find only 
a temporary abode is proved by their being so frequently encysted, 
and by their restless state, for they perforate the flesh, the walls of 
the stomach, and the substance of the different organs, digging and 
boring with their four proboscides that can be forced in and out, 
and are covered with innumerable recurved hooklets. VON SIEBOLD

common disc. 

Sp. Diplozoon paradoxum NORDM. MiTcrogr. Beit. i. Tab. v. vi. (and Ann. 
des Sc. not. Tom. xxx. PI. 20). This singular animal was discovered by 
NORDMANN on the gills of the Bream (Cyprinus brama) ; it is 3 5 lines 
long, and presents a body as if two specimens of Octobothrium had grown 
together in the middle, like the Siamese twins. Other observers also have 
met with this animal on the gills of other species of the genus Cyprinus. 
DUJARDIN found very small entozoa on the gills which resembled a half 
Diplozoon, and formed thereof the genus Diporpa; he leaves it undeter- 
mined whether they are young and separate individuals of Diplozoon. 
[This question has been determined in the affirmative by V. SIEBOLD. He 
discovered in the middle of the posterior portion of the body two slender 
booklets which had been overlooked by DUJARDIN in Diporpa and by 
NORDMANN in Diplozoon : they are bent back at an acute angle. Diporpa 
is without sex, and always much smaller than Diplozoon; it has, moreover, 
behind the middle of the body, at that part where the two bodies of 
Diplozoon coalesce, a sucker. The prehensile organs are much simpler in 
Diporpa than in Diplozoon; but SIEBOLD found instances of every inter- 
mediate stage of complexity in them in different pairs of Diporpa which 
had coalesced, so that in some the resemblance to Diplozoon was in all 
respects exact. After this conjugation or copulation, the generative organs 
appear in the united individuals, and eggs are produced. See C. TH. V. 
SIEBOLD Ueber die Conjugation des Diplozoon paradoxum, nebst Bemerlcungen 
ueber die Conjugations- Process der Protozoen. In Zeitsch. fur Wissenscli. 
Zoologie, in. 1851, pp. 6268.] 

The motion of fluid which NORDMANN thought he perceived in the 
vessels and their branches (in each half of the animal there are on each side 
two principal stems) is according to later investigations to be ascribed to 
vibratile cilia which exist on the inner surface of these vessels and produce 
the appearance of a very rapid current. (EHRENBERG, WIEGMANN'S

Pentastoma moniliforme DIESING 1. 1. Tab. iv. figs, n 13 ; in the lungs

The name Pentastoma is to be rejected, because the four lateral openings 
near the mouth are not mouths, and because by its resemblance to similar 
names of genera of Trematoda it may easily mislead to the idea of an 
union with this division. It is, however, so generally received, that it can 
scarcely be altered without needless confusion. The name Linguatula of 
FRGELICH as the older would deserve the preference, but it applies properly

and especially to that found in the lungs of the hare by FR<ELICH, and not

Pentastoma in the egg that it ought to be placed amongst the Acarina or

two pairs of lateral appendages or feet, each foot furnished with two claws,

Note. To the Nematoidea are also referred some filiform entozoa, included

the intestines and elsewhere a white worm of this sort, convoluted spirally, 
is found, which LINNAEUS called Gordius marinus, EUDOLPHI Filaria 
piscium. Comp. SIEBOLD in WIEGM. Archiv. iv. 1838, pp. 305, &c. 
Here also belongs a microscopic worm found by OWEN in the muscles of 
man, and called Trichina spiralis. See Transact, of the Zool. Soc. I. 4to.

state, the rest of whose fortunes are unknown ? [This is V. SIEBOLD'S 
opinion. The encysted Trichina is sexless and does not increase in size. 
Sometimes the liver of different marine fishes is beset with cysts containing 
round worms which have grown to an inch or more in length ; they have 
been named A scar is capsularis, Filaria piscium, &c. SIEBOLD could never 
discover in them sexual organs, but still they have so remarkable a 
resemblance to Ascaris osculata, spiculigera, angidata, &c., worms with 
developed sexual organs which live in the intestinal canal of the Seal, the 
Cormorant, the Diver, the Gull, and predaceous fishes, that they may be 
suspected to be related to them. SIEBOLD believes that the encysted sexless 
worms only attain their perfect development in the intestine of the verte- 
brates which have swallowed their temporary hosts. VON SIEBOLD Band

APPENDIX 

TO THE CLASS OF INTESTINAL WORMS. 



THERE are certain worms which do not live in other animals, 
>ut reside in water, or in moist earth, or in vegetable substances 
undergoing acetous fermentation, and which, nevertheless, since in 
brm and internal structure they correspond with Ascaris, Oxyuris, 
or Filaria, appear to belong to the order of thread- worms. Some 
)f them were by former writers arranged amongst the Infusories, as 
species of the genus Vibrio. To these belong the minute animals 
which LINNAEUS brought together under the name of Chaos redivi- 
vum, and which were described and figured by MUELLER as varieties 
)f one species, Vibrio anguillula (Animalcula infusoria, pp. 63-68), 
though he doubted whether they ought not to be regarded as 
different species of a genus for which he had altready proposed the 
name Anguillula, by naming them Anguillula aceti, Ang. glutinis, 
Ang. fluviatilis, and Ang. marina. The genus Anguillula was 
afterwards adopted by EHRENBERG to distinguish these animals 
rom Vibrio 1 . DUJARDIN named the same genus RJiabditis, but 
assigned to it somewhat different characters. 

Anguillula EHRENB. (Rhabditis DUJ.) Body filiform, pellucid. 
VIouth round, terminal, naked. Anus before the posterior extre- 
mity, sub-terminal. The male with tail naked or amplified by a 
membrane (alate). External genital organ a double spiculum. 
Tail of the female conical, acute.

these animals may be frozen without dying, whilst occasionally on the other 
hand a slightly increased temperature affects them mortally. Another 
species, Anguillula glutinis, lives in sour paste (MuELL. In/us. Tab. IX.

in the index he keeps Anguillula as the name of a genus, (see s. 847).

grains of blighted ears of corn may be revived, after lying dry for months 
and years, by moistening, (NEEDHAM and BAUER).

Also in the intestinal canal of insects minute worms have been observed 
and commonly considered to be Ascandes, which belong to this division 1 . 

In other species the mouth is provided internally with three 
unciform structures or jaws. They may be included in the genus 
Enoplus DUJARD. (Enoplus, Oncholaimus DUJARD., Ambtyura 
EHRENB.?) They live in fresh and salt water. 

Finally, certain small worms that live in water and in moist 
earth cannot well be placed otherwise than in the neighbourhood of 
the Nemato'idea; they are included in the genus Gordius L. (the 
Filarice excepted). They are, however, distinguished from the 
Nematoids by their structure, and especially by the absence of 
a posterior aperture in the intestinal canal. DUJARDIN and V. SIE- 
BOLD have shewn that these animals in the early period of then- 
life live parasitically in insects.

CLASS VI. 
WHEEL-ANIMALCULES (ROTATORIA} 1 . 

WE return from the consideration of different animals whose 
Dodies amongst the Invertebrates may be styled large to that world, 
.nvisible to the naked eye, with which in the class of the Infusories 
we began to treat of the animal kingdom. And in the classes 
that follow, however some species may be found that are scarcely 
Derceptible to the unassisted eye, no one of them consists entirely 
of creatures so small as Infusories and Wheel-animalcules. Wheel- 
animalcules, as a whole, surpass Infusories in size ; still they are 
very minute animal forms, mostly between J ^5 millimeter. LEEU- 
WENHOECK, who discovered the Infusories, was also the first who 
observed some species of Wheel-animalcules. 

The name of Wheel-animalcules is borrowed from the vibratile 
cilia which at the anterior extremity of the body are set upon the 
margin of a disc capable of eversion and inversion. In species, 
where that margin is not divided or indented, an optical illusion is 
caused by the motion of the cilia, as though a toothed wheel were 
revolving with great velocity in a circle, and so LEEUWENHOECK 
thought such was really the case, who compared the rotatory organ 
with the wheel of a watch-work 2 . Every one who has observed 
the phenomenon of vibrating cilia is aware that the deceptive 
appearance of a rapid motion or current in a given direction is pro- 
duced : if, then, vibrating cilia be met with on the smooth margin 
of a circular structure, the appearance of a rotating wheel will 
follow of course. It is to be remarked, however, that the motion is 



1 See on this class the works referred to (p. 37) at the class of Infusoria of 
MUELLER, EHRENBERG and DUJARDIN. Also may be compared O. SCHMIDT Versuch

geschichte, 1846, s. 67 81, Taf. in. 

2 Send-brieven, 1718, vn. Brief, bl. 67. DUTROCHET has attempted to explain the 
phenomenon by muscular motion ; according to him the wheel is merely a circular, 
muscular string, which by its contraction causes other parts of the gelatinous substance 
to project alternately in the form of conical papillae, whence a circular motion appears 
to arise. Ann. du Museum, XX. 1813, pp. 469 473.

196 CLASS VI. 

subjected to the will of the animal, for otherwise the vibratile cilia 
would be in a constant motion, which ceases only on death. 

The Wheel-animalcules are capable of contraction in a remark- 
able manner, many of them assuming thereby an oval form. This 
faculty of contraction gave occasion to the name Systolides, by 
which DUJARDIN wishes to distinguish this class of animals, but 
which probably will not supersede that of Rotatoria. In some the 
integument is hard and rigid, so as to form a shield or a shell 
(Bracliionus, Anurcea, &c.). In most there is a caudiform appendage 
on the abdominal surface (EHRENBERG names it processus pediformis 
or pseudopodium) , which can be drawn in and out annularly like 
a telescope, and ends in a suctorial disc or in a forceps; by it the 
Rotatories fix the posterior extremity of the body, whenever, being 
at rest, they set the wheel-organ in motion. 

The intestinal canal is straight, in by far the greatest number 
of species, and the anus is found at the hinder end, at the base of 
the tail. At the commencement of the intestinal canal, behind the 
oral aperture, is a muscular organ of cylindrical form armed with two 
lateral horny jaws. LEEUWENHOECK, BAKER and FONTANA took 
this structure for a heart, and its motions of grasping and opening, 
as the first of these authors so aptly describes them 1 , for the con- 
traction and expansion of the heart; whereon FONTANA expresses 
his surprise that such motions should be dependent upon the will 
of the animal. The lateral jaws indicate a similarity of form with 
articulate animals, the insects and crustaceans, and some writers 
have even supposed that the Wheel-animalcules may be regarded 
as very simply organised crustaceans 2 . On the whole, by inserting 
these animals between the intestinal and the articulate worms, the 
nearest affinities and natural place of the class are not indicated; 
but in an arrangement that gives the classes in succession, there 
must always be much that is arbitrary, for the affinities cannot be 
represented by a single ascending series. 

The lateral jaws present themselves under two forms. In the 
greater number they consist of two pieces ; the posterior serves as 
a pedicle, for the attachment of the muscles of mastication; the 
anterior passes transversely inwards at a right or obtuse angle, and

WHEEL-ANIMALCULES. 197 

ends in a single point, or in several teeth when the part becomes 
broad and indented in form of fingers. In other Rotatories the 
jaws have the form of two stirrups, with the bases turned towards 
each other, on which lie two or more teeth transversely, which 
arise from the outermost arch l . 

[Where the oesophagus opens into the stomach, or lower down, 
are two or more oval glandular pouches, which EHRENBERG com- 
pared to the pancreas. The stomach is large and sacculated, and 
in the saccules are large nucleated cells, or coeca are appended to 
them. The cells and cosca are supposed to supply the office of a 
liver. The intestine narrower, and of variable length, but generally 
short, opens into a cloaca, of which the outlet is on the dorsal sur- 
face at the extremity of the body. But sometimes the intestine 
and anal outlet are wanting, and then the residue of digestion is 
returned by the mouth 2 . The stomach and intestine are covered 
with fine vibratile cilia. 

This description applies only to the females ; for, in the year 
1849, the very interesting discovery of the male of Notommata 
anglicawas made by BRIGHTWELL S of Norwich, and in it the entire 
intestinal tract was absent ; there were neither pharynx, jaws, oeso- 
phagus, nor digestive tube, and the mouth was closed. 

There is no circulating system. The nutrient fluid fills the 
cavity of the body, and bathes all the contained organs. The re- 
spiratory organ is supposed to be represented by tortuous tubes, 
which are seen at each side of the body. A highly contractile 
transparent vesicle opens into the cloaca, and from this vesicle the 
tubes in question arise. To the tube on each side, minute pedi- 
culated structures, various in number, with vibratile leaflets, are 
attached. 

The female organs consist of an ovary situated under the diges- 
tive tube, generally of an oval form, or like a horse-shoe, of which 
the efferent duct opens into the cloaca. 

The ova are of two different kinds, summer- and winter- eggs, thin- or thick-shelled. 
The summer-eggs are developed within the parent body, and the animal is then vivi 
parous. The winter-eggs have been described by EHRENBERG, by HUXLEY, and by 
LEYDIG, in many different species: their thicker external covering is granular, or 
tuberculated, or beset with hairs. The winter-eggs are always laid, or are attached

to the mother and carried about by her (BracJtionus, &c.) ; and thus, in the cold season 
of the year, these animals are oviparous. 

Besides the male of Notommata anglica, discovered by BRIGHTWELL, that of N. 
Sieboldii has been observed by LEYDIG, who further gives reasons for believing that 
Enteroplca hydatina EHR. is the male of Hydatina senta, Notommata granularis the 
male of Notom. Bratitiionus, and Diglena granularis the male of Dig. catcllina. 
GOSSE also has ascertained that the sexes are distinct in many others 1 . The males 
are less than the females, and also differ in form in most cases. The dioecious character 
of the class may thus be considered to be established. 

The generative organs of the males consist of a white and round 
bladder or testis, filled with spermatozoa, and an efferent duct 
(penis DALRYMPLE) ciliated in the interior, which opens close to 
the outlet of the respiratory vesicle. All the males observed are 
entirely destitute of digestive tract; they possess the respiratory 
organs of their species, whose function seems to suffice for the 
maintenance of their short life, employed exclusively in impreg- 
nating the females.] 

The nervous system has been discovered by EHRENBERO in 
different genera, and he described, as central portion, different ganglia 
(ganglia cephalica seu cerebralio^ situated close to the wheel-organ, 
from which distinct nerves arise. In Hydatina senta, according to 
the investigations of the same observer, two threads also arise from 
them that run downwards on the abdominal surface, and unite to form 
a ganglion from which a single nervous string with many small 
ganglia or swellings arise 2 . As organs of sense, in most of them red 
eye-spots (generally two, sometimes one or three, seldom more than 
four) have been perceived; sometimes these exist in young individuals 
alone, and disappear on full growth, as in the genus Floscularia. 

Besides the muscles of the special parts, there are found in many species thin 
bundles of muscles running longitudinally, one on the dorsal surface, one on the 
abdominal surface, and two lateral. 

With respect to the geographic distribution of Wheel-animalcules nothing deter- 
minate can yet be specified. Only do we know, from the observations and notices of 
EHRENBERG, that, besides Europe, they are found in northern and western Asia, in 
the north of Africa and in North America. Beyond doubt they occur in all quarters 
of the world. The physiological peculiarity of life suspended for a length of time, to 
be again awakened by the vital stimulus of fluid, has given a special celebrity to these 
animals. On this subject we refer to what will be offered below when we notice 
Rotifer vulgar is, in which this phenomenon has been chiefly observed.

system in Notommata (s. 425) and in Diglena (s. 443), but in all there lies a principal 
mass, as the collection of nervous ganglia, on the dorsal surface of the anterior 
extremity of the body.

CLASS VI. 
ROTATORIA. 

MICROSCOPIC animals, contractile, crowned with vibratile cilia at 
the anterior part of the body, which by their motion often resemble 
a wheel revolving rapidly. Intestine distinct, terminated at one

PELTIER and other observers, not vibratile cilia, but are capable 
individually of expansion and contraction ; EHRENBERG, who admits 
that these hairs may for a long 'time continue at rest and be flaccid, 
still maintains that they occasionally vibrate, and refers to EICHHORN 
who perceived the same thing in his crown-polyp, Stephanoceros

ROTATORIA. 203 

[DUJARDIN (Infus. p. 268, 1841) gave reasons for the exclusion of 
Chcetonotus and Ichthydium from the JKotatoria, and placed them 
provisionally in his order Infusoires symetriques. Afterwards 
C. YOGT referred them to the Turbellaria. SCHTILTZE discovered in 
the sea-sand at Cuxhaven (1853) a new genus and species closely 
allied in anatomical structure to our Ichthydina, which he named 
Turbanella hyalina. Neither in Ichthydium nor Chcetonotus do the 
cilia form a true wheel-organ round the mouth capable of protrusion 
and retraction. In Ichthydium they are spread over the entire 
abdominal surface ; in Chcetonotus over the whole of the anterior half 
of the abdomen, and at the margin of the posterior half form a band 
which surrounds the closely set, stiff hairs, which are much finer than 
the spines on the dorsal surface and directed backwards to cover the 
non- ciliated portion of the abdomen. The tail is forked, but not 
jointed. The intestine is straight, the anal opening at the fork of 
the tail. Neither vessels, nerves, nor muscles can be seen, except 
that the oesophagus is muscular. The sexual organs are situated 
between the intestinal canal and the integument of the back, the 
testes consisting of a loose cluster of vesicles in front of the ovary. 
SCHULTZE concludes that the Ichthydina of EHRENBERG (exclusive of 
his genera Ptygura and G-lenophora which are true rotatories) must 
be excluded from the Rotatoria, and that they belong more nearly 
to the Turbellaria than to any other order of worms. There are 
however remarkable differences of structure between them and 
any family of Turbellaria. For in those Turbellaria which have a 
straight intestine with anal opening, the sexes are distinct j whilst 
in those which are hermaphrodite the intestine has no anal opening. 
SCHULTZE contends however that in worms the characteristic derived 
from the form of the intestinal canal is of greater systematic value 
than that derived from the formation of the sexual organs : and 
recommends that the Ichthydina, limited as above, be placed pro- 
visionally amongst the Microstoma of the order Turbellaria, which 
will then require to be subdivided into the dio3cious and the monoe- 
cious (Ichthydina). See SCHULTZE in MUELLER'S Archiv. 1853.

This Wheel-animalcule was first discribed and figured by LEEUWENHOECK

206 CLASS VI. 

that this animal, which he had found in a leaden gutter of his house, after 
it had been dried with the sand and other matters that adhered to it, 
revived again, when after two days he poured water upon it, which, having 
been previously boiled, could contain no living animalcule. He afterwards 
found that the same phenomenon occurred after a lapse of five months 
(bl. 413). Different observers repeated these experiments. FONTANA 
found Wheel-animalcules that had been dried for two years and a half 
revive on being moistened (Traite sur le venin de la Vipere I., Florence, 
1781, 4to. pp. 90, 92), and SPALLANZANI saw the waking from slumber 
occur even after four years (Opuscules de Physique, traduits par J. SENEBIER, 
Geneve, 1777, II. p. 310). The last-named observer saw the same pheno- 
menon many times in succession ; nay, even eleven times he saw alternately 
apparent death and life. A few minutes are often sufficient to revive the 
creatures ; but such alone as were surrounded with sand and other matter, 
not those which lying quite bare had been dried, were revived. Observations 
in the present century also are not wanting, by DUTROOHET, C. SCHULTZE 
(according to EHRENBERG on Philodina), and others. 

This phenomenon does not stand quite alone. We have spoken above of 
Anguillula (p. 194), and SPALLANZANI observed the same phenomenon in a 
microscopic aquatic animal, which he named Tardigrade, and which has 
been called Arctiscon by other writers. DUJARDIN brings this and other 
similar animals as well as the Wheel-animalcules into the same class of 
Systolides; but we are of opinion that they ought rather to be placed, as 
very imperfect forms of Arachno'idea, with the Acari. It is on these tar- 
digrades that DOYERE not long ago performed his very interesting experi- 
ments, and also, after most perfect desiccation of the animals when quite 
uncovered, succeeded in reviving them (Ann. des Sc. not. 2 e geVie, 1842. 
Tom. xvni. Zoologie, pp. 535). 

To these observations no exception can well be taken ; the facts must 
either be stoutly denied or be accepted as we find them. SPALLANZANI 
asserted incorrectly that life was quite gone, and that a real revival 
occurred (1. 1. p. 322). LEEUWENHOECK expressed himself more cautiously. 
BONNET too speaks of a seeming death, and says that life is not quite 
extinguished (Consid. sur les corps organises, (Euvres, Neuchatel, 1779, 
8vo. vi. p. 224, Contemplation de la nature, ibid. Tom. vm. p. 262). VON 
HUMBOLDT calls the state of apparent death in these animals one of sleep, 
or of suspended life (Versuche uber die gereizte Muskel-und Nervenfaser, 
1797. 8vo. I. s. 296). In this desiccated state life is potentially present, 
but does not announce itself by actual phenomena. If we choose to name 
this life latent, we must not call death itself a latent life; certainly these 
animals are not dead, but their life is brought to a stand by the want of 
one of the most common and most necessary of vital stimuli, by the want 
of water. 



CLASS VII. 
RINGED WORMS (ANNULATA^. 

LINNAEUS placed (vid. p. 30) all animals that are destitute of a 
proper internal skeleton in two classes, that of Insects and that of 
Worms. In reviewing the principal modifications which subsequent 
writers have introduced into the general classification of the animal 
kingdom, we find that they relate chiefly to the animals placed by 
LlNNJEUS in the latter class. All those classes which we have 
hitherto treated of have been formed by separation from the Lix- 
N^EAN class of worms ; all the animals which we shall describe in 
the sequel as Molluscs formed collectively a portion of the same 
great division. Amongst creatures so numerous and of such variety 
of form, there are some which in type, or plan of organisation, 
approximate towards insects; they are, like insects, articulate 
animals, but differ from them by the absence of articulate feet. As 
early as the end of the last century CUVIER made of these a distinct 
division of the animal kingdom under the name of Worms, and, at

the same time, added to it the Entozoa 1 . Some years afterwards 
CUVIER discovered that many of these animals have red-coloured 
blood, and thought that a name implying this was justifiable (vers 
a sang rouge], whilst LAMARCK, on account of the rings into which 
their body is divided, named them Annelides. 

It was necessary to premise these historical notices in order to 
make it clear why we have given to this class of animals the name 
"Kinged Worms;" and, notwithstanding, include in it animals 
whose body is not divided into rings. The name may be defended 
by similar instances from other classes of animals, where names do 
not always suit all the individuals in them 2 . But, further, we 
prefer this name to that of " Worms," because this last is too 
indeterminate, and, as has been alleged above, has a double meaning. 

One of the best writers on the Annulata is 0. F. MUELLER, to 
whom the whole of Zoology is indebted for distinguished services. 
The immortal PALLAS, also, -described many ringed worms, and 
investigated them anatomically. In the present century they have 
been especially investigated by SAVIGNY, MILNE EDWARDS, GRUBE 
and OERSTED. EHRENBERG has placed some of these worms, 
on account of the vibratile cilia with which their integument is 
beset, in a separate class, under the name Turbdlaria. But, besides 
that we think too great a multiplicity of classes is to be avoided, 
some of these Turbellaria approach far too nearly to other natural 
divisions of the Annulata to allow us to place them in a distinct 
class of the animal kingdom 3 . 

CUVIER and LAMARCK placed the Annulata higher in the animal 
kingdom than the rest of the articulates ; above the Crustaceans. It 
is true that the last-named Zoologist considered the Crustaceans to be 
the more highly organised, but believing that the Annulata ought to 
stand above the Insects, and that it was inexpedient to break the con- 
nected series formed by the Insects, Arachnoids, and Crustaceans, 



1 Tableau element, de VHist. not. des Animaux, 1798, p. 624 ; Le$. d'Anat. com- 
paree I. ivi&me Tableau. LAMAKCK adopted the same class in his Systeme des Anim. 
sans vertebres, i8or, p. 315. 

2 The class of the Acalephce for instance, the order of the hemiptera, a name which 
is properly applicable to the division of the heteroplera alone. 

3 In the following general view of the internal structure of this class we shall 
especially fix oiir regards on those animals which indicate most clearly the articulate 
type; for the rest we refer to the special notices in the Systematic Arrangement. 



RINGED-WORMS. 209 

by the Annulata, he preferred to place these last at the top. We 
are quite as ready to acknowledge that Articulates with articulate feet 
form a single connected series, and would not therefore separate 
them from each other; but we place the Annulata below the Insects, 
not above the Crustaceans. This arrangement, formerly adopted by 
us when it was less common, appears now to be generally received; 
even by Frenchmen, as, for instance, MILNE EDWARDS. 

The body of ringed-worms is generally much elongated and 
cylindrical; in some instances it is broader and oval. It is divided 
by transverse folds into rings or girdles, which, in most species, are 
very numerous, and in one and the same species may vary greatly 
in number, at least when that number is very great. The common 
Leech has about 100 such, Eunice gigantea above 400 ; in Phyllo- 
doce laminosa SAV., AUDOUIN and MILNE EDWARDS found nearly 
500 rings, whilst in other individuals of the same species there 
were sometimes only 300. The integument is always soft, not 
corneous, but some of them live in sheaths or shells, sometimes 
compacted with bits of shell or grains of sand into a mosaic work 
of considerable strength, and sometimes consisting of calcareous 
matter, as in the genus Serpula. 

In some the head is not distinct from the succeeding rings of 
the body. In others it is distinguished from the trunk by its 
different form, and is provided with eyes and even with threads, 
which many authors name Antennae, after the so-named parts in 
Insects and Crustaceans; but they differ from these, and can be 
pushed in and out like the horns or feelers on the head of snails. 
The number of these feelers differs ; there are rarely more than five, 
and some species have only a single thread of the kind. 

On the rings of the body spines or hairs are usually set, which 
however may be entirely wanting in some, as in the leech. In 
most the hairs or spines are placed upon minute lateral tubercles, 
which may be considered as rudiments of feet. These rudimentary 
feet are, however, never jointed as in insects. They are usually 
divided into two parts, which may be named oars or fins; one on 
the dorsal surface, another on the ventral surface (rame dorsale et 
rame ventrale SAVIGNY). On each of these two projections a 
bundle of hairs (setce) is set, of very different form ; and, besides this, 
each projection has, as the rule, a conical spine that can be re- 
tracted into its sheath and is called needle (acus). Moreover, at the 
VOL. I. 14 



210 CLASS VII. 

base, or foot-piece of each of these oars there is usually placed 
a filiform appendage (cirrus). In the Dorsibranchiates there are 
found, in addition, on the dorsal surface towards the sides and near 
the oars, or upon them, the external respiratory organs, Gills, of 
various forms ; sometimes divided like a comb, or branched like a 
tree, sometimes composed of simple filiform appendages resembling 
the cirri of the oars. In other ringed-worms the gills are situated 
at the most anterior part of the body. In the Leech, the Earth- 
worm, and allied genera, no respiratory organs are visible externally. 

In those ringed-worms that have not a distinct head, the mouth 
is usually found quite at the anterior extremity of the body ; in the 
rest it is situated on the* inferior surface, and usually a muscular 
proboscis can be everted (Phyllodoce Nereis, &c.). In these, more- 
over, the mouth is ordinarily armed with horny jaws, placed late- 
rally, differing in number in the different genera. Occasionally the 
number is not the same on the two opposite sides. Thus the genera 
(Enone and Aglaura SAV. have four jaws on the right, five on the 
left ; Lysidice and Leonice three on the right, and four on the left. 

The intestinal canal is, for the most part, straight, yet there are 
exceptions. In Sabella ventilabrum the canal makes a great num- 
ber of transverse flexures, lying upon one another, and winding 
sometimes to the right, sometimes to the left : the first portion 
alone, the oesophagus, is straight 1 ; GRUBE observed the same dis- 
position in Cirratulus 2 . In Amphictene (Amphitrite auricoma bet- 
gica Cuv.) the intestinal canal makes two flexures, as in Holothuria, 
first proceeding backwards, then straight forwards, and then back- 
wards again with a narrower portion between the two others 3 . In 
the remainder, where the canal is straight, there are usiially lateral 
appendages, or it is as though divided into cells by transverse 
constrictions. In the Earth-worm a short round stomach succeeds 
to the oesophagus, and then there is another muscular stomach. In 
Arenicola the middle wider portion of the intestinal canal has very 
thin walls, and is covered with very regular vascular reticulations

dividing it, as it were, into cells. Two conical yellow coecal pouches 
are placed at the commencement of this portion of intestine : they 
may probably be considered to be rudiments of the liver. In 
the common Leech, the short oesophagus, of an oval form, wider 
towards the middle of its length, passes into a long stomach, which 
is divided by transverse walls into eleven portions: on each side are 
seen ten coecal appendages to the stomach, the last of these being 
the longest ; the inferior opening of the stomach (Pylorus) extends, 
like a funnel, into the intestine by a narrow opening. In other 
genera of Hirudinea, ex. gr. in Hcemopsis, the intestinal canal is 
more simple, having only two ccecal appendages 1 . In Aphrodita 
there succeeds to a very muscular cylindrical tube, which PALLAS 
described as stomach, a thin intestinal canal of considerable width 
with about twenty coecal appendages on each side 2 . These append- 
ages are narrow at their insertion into the intestine, wider in their 
middle, where they are provided with branched lappets, and termi- 
nate in longish ccecal sacs. This structure recalls the disposition 
of the intestinal canal in Planarice and Distomata, and the blind 
branched appendages of the intestinal canal in Star-fishes may be 
compared with it. They are filled, as these are, with yellow fluid, 
and may be compared to rudiments of liver. In other animals again 
the liver appears as a protrusion of the intestinal canal. 

The system of Blood-vessels presents very many modifications 
in this class. As to the blood itself, we have seen above, that 
CUVIER believed it to be red in all the ringed-worms. Such is 
really the case in by far the greater number, as Hirudo, Lumbricus, 
Arenicola, Nereis, Terebella, Serpula, &c.: in others it is nearly 
colourless, as in Aphrodite: yellow, as in Polynoe and Phyllodoce, or 
even green, as MILNE EDWARDS found it in a species of Sabella. The 
general arrangement of the circulating apparatus is as follows: there 
are two main stems, one on the dorsal surface, the other on the 
ventral surface, which run in the midst through the whole length 
of the body, and as far as the course of the blood could be deter- 
mined in the living body (for which investigation small indivi- 
duals are frequently more fitted than large ones, on account of their

worm (Lumbricus) the two trunks are united in the anterior part of 
the body by five or more (7 9) arches widened like strings of 
pearls. (It is almost impossible not to recall here the vascular arches 
which in the embryos of mammals run along the branchial fissures.) 
In others the connexion forwards is effected by vascular plexuses 
(retia mirabilia)*. The dorsal vessel is usually considered to be 
arterial, the abdominal venous : and in most of the ringed-worms 
this opinion is not without ground, as might indeed have been con- 
cluded from analogy with other articulates. Sometimes the anterior 
part of the dorsal vessel becomes wider, resembling a rudiment of a 
heart, which then is in most cases an arterial heart like that of 
spiders and crustaceans. The exception however observed by 
MILNE EDWARDS must not be forgotten; in Terebella the heart 
drives the blood to the gills, and must therefore be considered to be 
a venous heart, analogous to that of fishes. 

Other less important modifications of the vascular system consist 
in the breaking up of the two main stems into several, which are 
sometimes quite separate from each other, though placed in proxi- 
mity (Nephthys, Eunice), or in the presence of lateral longitudinal 
stems. In Pleione carunculata there are as many as seven longitu- 
dinal stems : four on the ventral surface, of which the middle ones 
are small and lie at the sides of the nervous system, and the two 
outer which are larger and give twigs to the gills, and three on the 
dorsal surface, of which the two lateral receive the blood from the 
gills, and are connected by transverse branches with the third or 
median trunk 3 . In the Leech there are four principal stems, one 
dorsal, one abdominal, and two, larger than these, lateral.

where an arched vessel at the anterior extremity of the body unites the two longitudinal 
vessels. GRUITHUISEN, Anat. der gezungelten Nalde, Nov. Act. Acad. Cces. Leap.

RINGED-WORMS. 213 

Eespiration is effected by the skin, or by external gills of very 
different form, or by vesicles on the sides of the body. In the Leech 
there are found about seventeen such vesicles on each side, which 
open on the abdominal surface. The openings are extremely minute, 
and between two of them on each side there are four rings or seg- 
ments of the body without such openings. A white convoluted 
structure is connected with these vesicles by means of a thin pedicle, 
and contains (according to DUGES) a blood-vessel in its interior. 
That these vesicles secrete mucus, is no proof that they are not 
respiratory organs ; some writers think that it is their sole function 
to supply that secretion; and BRANDT believes that respiration in 
the Leech is effected by the skin. At all events, though these 
vesicles receive and return blood-vessels, they have not a perfectly 
separate circulation of blood in them, and the respiratory organs 
would seem to receive in this case, as in that of Reptiles, a portion 
only of the venous blood. In the Earth-worm there are more than a 
hundred such vesicles ; their openings are on the abdominal surface, 
according to LEO and DUGES, whilst MECKEL and MORREN think 
that they are connected with a single series of apertures on the 
dorsal surface, which WILLIS formerly described and compared to 
the spiracles of Insects 1 . 

The ringed-worms, until within the last few years, were sup- 
posed, almost universally, to be bisexual. It was only in the 
AphroditcB that a separation of the sexes was, with some hesitation, 
accepted, when PALLAS had shewn that certain individuals were full 
of eggs at the same time that in others the cavity of the abdomen 
contained a tenacious milky fluid 2 . Afterwards EATHKE also found 
a separation of the sexes in Amphitrite*, and QUATREFAGES observed 
the same in a large number of marine ringed-worms (tukicolce and 
errantia) 4 . The observations of STEENSTRUP on Lepidonote, Phyllo- 
doce, Nereis , Nephthys, Terebella, and Serpula are to the same effect: 
in the last genus the sexual distinction may be recognised by the 



consulted, and especially MILNE EDWARDS, Ann. des Sc. not. sec. Sdrie, Tom. x.

colour shining through the skin, which is white in male individuals 
and reddish in female. Other differences of external appearance 
in the two sexes are not known, unless we except an observation of 
OERSTED, which however is not altogether free from doubt, accord- 
ing to which in a new genus very nearly allied to Syllis, which he 
names Exogone, the male individuals are distinguished by longer 
hairs, as they are in the genus Nais 1 . There still remain the 
genera of the Hirudinea and Lumbricmi, in which STEENSTRUP in- 
deed adopts separation of sex under similar external form of the 
parts : but this requires confirmation after accurate investigation, for 
it is in conflict with earlier observations, whilst by later it is in part 
contradicted 2 . On the whole, no common type can be assigned for 
the genital organs : for the most part, there are some pairs of vesicles 
(ovaria, testes) in the fore part of the body. In some Annulata setigera, 
apertures at the base of the foot-swellings have been seen, through 
which passes seed or eggs : but in many of them such an outlet is still 
unknown. For the most part, external genital organs are deficient : 
neither does copulation occur, except in Lumbricini and Hirudinea. 

The development of the egg has been investigated only in a 
few species. Here also that remarkable cleaving and successive 
division of the yelk has been observed, which KiJSCONi and YON 
BAER first detected in the eggs of frogs and of fishes. The deve- 
lopment of the embryo begins on the abdominal surface, and the 
yelk lies on the dorsal surface, as in Crustaceans and Insects : two 
abdominal streaks are observed at the commencement of develop- 
ment, which recall the dorsal plates of vertebrate animals 3 . 

The most recent times have made us acquainted with some 
remarkable metamorphoses in the course of the development of 
ringed- worms. LOVEN found the first stage in a worm of the 
family of the Nereids (probably a species of Phyllodoce) to resemble

RINGED-WORMS. 215 

a hemispherical or conical body of about J millim. terminating in a 
ciliated disc on whose edge the mouth seemed to be placed. At 
the pole of the hemisphere was the anus. This conical body 
increased gradually in length and became divided into rings gra- 
dually more numerous, the last formed ring being that next the 
disc (just as in ESCHRICHT'S observations on BoihriocepJialus the 
new rings were formed in the anterior part of the body). Each ring 
originally consisted of four pieces : an anterior and a posterior 
piece being larger, almost a semicircle, and a smaller piece on each 
side connecting them. The disc with its vibrating cilia diminished 
gradually and became changed into two fin-like appendages to the 
head, from which the feelers probably proceed 1 . SARS saw the 
incipient form of Polynoe cir-rata as a short, oval, inarticulate body 
with a transverse circle of vibratile cilia round the middle 2 . It 
may be confidently asserted therefore that there is a metamorphosis; 
parts are present which afterwards disappear (the vibratile cilia), 
others are deficient which are afterwards developed, and the entire 
form is changed. 

The Reproductive force is, in some animals of this class very 
great, in others small, although worms that have been cut through 
transversely continue to live for a long time, as has been observed 
in the leech, and by 0. F. MUELLER in Nereis versicolor. TREM- 
BLEY'S experiments on the Fresh-water Polyp induced BONNET to 
repeat them on Fresh-water Worms (Naides), and he found that 
the pieces he had cut off grew into new worms 3 . MUELLER also 
succeeded in similar experiments 4 . It has been thought also that 
they have succeeded in the Earth-worm, but here they have con- 
stantly failed with other experimenters. According, however, to 
the experiments of DUGES a few rings at the anterior part of the 
body may be reproduced and gradually changed into a head 5 .

216 CLASS VII. 

The Nervous System in the Annulata proper consists, as in 
Insects, of ganglia connected by two cords and placed behind each 
other in a series in the middle of the body on the abdominal sur- 
face. Originally each ganglion consists of two lateral portions, as 
is proved by the process of development : on the regeneration also 
of parts that have been cut away the nervous system appears to be 
formed of two lateral portions. A larger ganglion lies in the head, 
and is connected, by two nervous threads that form a ring around 
the oesophagus, with the first ganglion of the abdominal chain. 
But the Nervous System presents much variety in different genera, 
as well in the number as in the greater or less development of the 
ganglia and in the nerves that spring from them ; whilst in the 
earth-worm, for instance, the numerous ganglia of the abdominal 
chain almost touch each other, in the leech they are only twenty- 
four or twenty -five in number, and are placed far asunder, especially 
in the middle. In Pleione carunculata the Nervous System con- 
sists, according to GRUBE, besides the middle chain, of two lateral 
cords, also with ganglia, which are connected with the former by 
transverse threads 1 . In Eunice sanguinea QUATREFAGES found 
minute ganglia at the base of the rudimentary feet, which however 
were not connected, as a chain, by longitudinal filaments. In ad- 
dition to this nervous apparatus a special nervous system has been 
detected in many instances, agreeing with that portion of the 
nervous system in Insects which has been compared to the Nervus 
sympathicus of the higher animals : of which we shall treat more 
at large at the class of Insects. In Hirudo medicinalis BRANDT 
discovered three minute ganglia in the head, which are united by 
threads with the cerebral ganglion, and from which the maxillary 
nerves arise ; with the middlemost of the three ganglia a nerve is 
probably in connexion, which runs beneath the stomach in a longi- 
tudinal direction and finally divides into two branches ; but this 
nerve differs from the sympathetic of insects in respect of its 
position on the inferior surface. In Eunice sanguinea and some 



1 Diss. zootom. de Pleione carunc. p. 9, figs, i, 5. STANNIUS (his, rSsi) observed 
the same thing in another species of Pleione (Amphinome rostrata). It is as though there 
were a repetition of the form of the vascular system on the dorsal surface, which here 
consists of three stems; see above (p. 212). Perhaps this arrangement occurs in 
several Annulata; at least WAGNER describes it also in Pontobdella muricata, Lehrb. 
der vergl. Anat. 1835, s. 381. 



RINGED-WORMS. 217 

Nereidce QUATREFAGES found this system to be composed of differ- 
ent ganglia, and named it, on account of its position on the pro- 
boscis, systime susoesophagien, or proboscidian superieur 1 . 

With respect to organs of sense, with the exception of tentacles 
and other appendages subservient to a finer sense of touch, for sight 
there are found in most species only coloured spots, usually black, 
of variable number, as special organs. According to I. MUELLER'S 
investigations in a Nereis, the eyes of ringed-worms contain no 
transparent parts, but are merely swellings of the visual nerves sur- 
rounded by black pigment. They are endowed with sensibility for 
light, and the worms can distinguish between light and darkness : 
but what is properly named sight, perception of the form of objects, 
such eyes cannot afford. In Alciopa lepidota KROHN however found 
a lens and a vitreous body. A special auditory organ has not been 
detected ; the first portion of the oesophagus is supposed to be the 
seat of taste. 

The organs of motion are in some more complicated than in 
others. In all muscular fibres are found beneath the skin, which 
may be separated more or less completely into layers : the external 
layer has a circular, the internal a longitudinal course. In some, as 
Aphrodite, these fibres are united to form distinct bundles. By means 
of the layers or bundles the body can be moved, contracted, extended, 
bent. Besides this general muscular system, motion of the body 
in the Leech can be also effected by means of a suctorial disc at its 
posterior part, in which there are circular and radiating fibres. The 
proboscis, which is capable of eversion and retraction, has proper 
muscles for these purposes. Concerning the bristles and hairs, 
which are found on many, we have already spoken above. These 
parts, springing from the sides, supply fixed points for the motions 
of the body, like the spines of the Echini: they are retracted, ex- 
tended or moved sideways by proper muscles. 

Many species of this class diffuse a phosphoric light. It is 



1 There lies also a small ganglion in front of the brain (ganglion cervical QUATRE- 
FAGES), and from the lateral parts of the brain a thread arises, which with that of the 
other side surrounds the mouth (Systeme sous-cesophagien labial au proboscidien 
inferieur) ; this last portion of the nervous system may be compared with the arrange- 
ment in the Mollusca gasteropoda. See on the nervous system of the Annelids 
a memoir of QUATREFAGES illustrated with beautiful figures, Ann. des Sc. not. 30 SeVie, 
Tom. II. Zoologie, 1844, pp. 81 104. 



218 CLASS VII. 

asserted that this phenomenon has been occasionally observed in 
the earth-worm (Lumbricus terrestris L.) It is quite certain that it 
has been seen to occur in very many marine Annelides: and hence 
these are creatures also which contribute to the illumination of the 
sea. Nereidce are especially noted in this respect : DUGES observed 
the phenomenon in a Mediterranean species 4" long, Syllis fulgu- 
rans 1 . QlJATREFAGES made the important discovery that, in certain 
minute marine Annelides (species of Syllis and Polynoe), the seat of 
the phenomenon is at the base of the feet-tubercles in fact in the 
muscles: it was only when the muscles contracted that the light 
appeared like an electric spark 2 . 

Ringed-worms are found in all countries and seas : but it is im- 
possible to present a view of the geographical distribution of the 
species hitherto known, for this class is perhaps more generally 
neglected by voyagers than any other, and we are acquainted with 
few marine annelides except those from the Atlantic ocean, the 
Mediterranean, and the Red sea. Of the genus Palmyra only one 
species is known, which was found at the Mauritius. From the 
Indian sea some large and beautiful species are known, as Laodicea 
gigantea; Serpula gigantea is from the West Indies : and, in general 
the large and beautiful species are most numerous in warm regions. 
Some species appear to have a very wide geographical distribution, 
as Hesione splendida, found by SAVIGN Y in the Red sea, and brought 
by MATTHIEU from the Island of Mauritius : and Pleione carunculata, 
which, according to PALLAS and SAVIGNY occurs in the American 
seas, according to SEBA in the Indian sea, and was found by GRUBE 
in the Mediterranean at Sicily. The Hirudinea and Lumlricini 
have scarcely been investigated elsewhere than in Europe.

SYSTEMATIC 
DISTRIBUTION OF ANNULATA 



CLASS VII. 
ANNULATA. 

ANIMALS elongate, living in waters or moist earth, not parasiti- 
cally in other animals, mostly articulate, without jointed feet, but often 
in place of feet supplied with setae or setiferous tubercles which are 
retractile. Respiration effected either by external branchiae or in- 
ternal sacs or by the skin itself. Organs of circulation in most 
distinct ; contractile vessels instead of heart. The nervous system 
composed of a cephalic ganglion single or double, and most fre- 
quently of a double ventral cord with ganglia at intervals. 

ORDER I. Turlellaria. 

Body cylindrical or depressed, most frequently inarticulate, or 
ringed by transverse rugse, beset with vibratile cilia. 

Family I. Planariece. Nutrient canal with one distinct aperture 
alone, anus none. Body inarticulate. 

This family was originally formed from the genus Planaria of 
O. F. MUELLEE, which was divided by later writers into other genera, 
and round which in consequence of new discoveries other different 
genera were arranged. It appears to us to be inconsistent with the 
idea of a class, to raise this group to that rank, as VON SIEBOLD has 
done, who has formed his class of the Turbella/ria, of it alone. The 
name Turbellaria was first, though in a more comprehensive sense, 
used by EiiEENBERG 1 (see above, p. 208). The phenomenon of 
rotatory motion in the water surrounding these animals, which gave 



Symboke physicce Anim. cverlebrata exclusis insectis, I. Berolini, 1831, fol. 



220 CLASS VII. 

occasion to the name, was first, as it seems, observed by DUGE*S in 
Planarice, although he did not refer it to cilia (Ann. des Sc. nat. 
Tom. xv. p. 165), whilst VON BAER observed at the same time an- 
other phenomenon which coul'd only be an effect of these cilia, 
that when a portion of these animals is cut off it continues to rotate 
circularly in the water (Nov. Act. Acad. Ccesar. Leop. Carol. Tom. 
xiii. P. 2, p. 711). 

The internal structure of these creatures was first recognised with 
precision in this century, especially through the investigations of 
DUGES, Y. BAER, FOKKE, OERSTED, and QUATREFAGES; it presents 
important differences in different genera whilst the external habitus 
is similar. We must confine ourselves to the notice of a few general 
traits. 

Besides the cilia on the external surface, the external integument 
in many is distinguished by the presence of cells with nettle-threads, 
like as we stated in Acalephae. Beneath the integument there is 
a layer of transparent, homogeneous tissue, which, according to 
QUATREFAGES, supplies, as it seems, the place of muscle, and by its 
contraction effects the movement of the body. The motion occurs 
by swimming in the water, the lateral margins beating to and fro, 
by creeping with bending and straightening of the body, or by equably 
gliding, much as the gasteropod molluscs move with their so-named 
foot. 

The oral aperture is sometimes more forward, sometimes more in 
the middle of the body on the ventral surface. The intestinal canal 
is in some straight, and extends itself, when the mouth is not placed 
quite forward, anteriorly as well as posteriorly, with blind termina- 
tions in both directions. In others the intestinal canal is like a 
tree divided into branches j in our fresh- water species one branch is 
seen to run forwards, on both sides provided with blind appendages, 
and two stems or main branches backwards at the sides of the body 
(in Planaria lactea the branches may be readily distinguished 
externally by their dark colour). In other species from sea- water 
the division of the branches is somewhat different ; sometimes quite 
retifonn. In the cavity of the mouth is situated a part that can 
be extended by eversion, serving for the seizure of food, and various 
in form. It is able, when severed from the living creature, to move 
independently for some time whilst it swallows greedily surrounding 
substances which are seen to pass out by the posterior open ex- 
tremity as through a funnel. With respect to the vascular system 
little is known ; that which is described as such by some writers, 



ANNULATA. 221 

belongs probably to the nervous system. In some species with 
straight intestinal canal, there have been observed at the sides two 
tortuous canals running longitudinally, which, without giving off 
lateral branches, bend round in a loop at the back part. Respira- 
tion is probably effected by the skin itself, and the water on the 
surface is constantly renewed by the vibratory motion. 

As nervous system in many a double nervous ganglion has been 
observed, which lies at the anterior end, and from which many 
branches arise. The eyes, which are in some instances very nume- 
rous, present in many a transparent body, corpus vitreum or lens 
crystallina. 

The reproductive power is very great, and severed parts grow, as 
appears from the observations especially of DUGES and J. R. JOHNSON, 
to new animals. In some propagation occurs by spontaneous division. 
The sexual organs have one common or two separate openings behind 
the mouth; in the latter case the anterior opening belongs to the 
male organs of copulation. Two long tubes supply the office of 
testes, and end as vasa deferentia in a seminal vesicle, with which a 
penis of various form is connected. The spermatozoa have been 
observed by QUATREFAGES and YON SIEBOLD. A double oviduct 
leads to a spacious vagina, into which two special hollow bodies also 
open. The eggs lie dispersed in the parenchyme of the body, 
between the ccecal branches of the intestinal canal (QUATREFAGES), 
where probably they are contained in special ramified tubes 
(ovaries).

sufficiently limited, consult EHRENBERG Synib. phys. Anim. evertebr.

Family II. Nemertini. Nutrient tube simple, with double 
aperture, anus terminal. Body elongate, extremely contractile, 
roundish, or depressed, indistinctly annulate. 

It is not without hesitation that, after OERSTED, we have given 
these characters of the family of the Nemertini, whilst amongst the 
different writers, with respect to the true nature of the distinct 
parts, a remarkable variety of opinion prevails, so that it is un- 
certain whether the aperture, considered as anus, really belongs to 
the intestinal canal. Beneath the skin in these worms muscular 
fibres are seen, of which the external layer runs longitudinally, the 
innermost annularly or transversely. A canal of uniform width, by 
many supposed to be the intestine, runs straight through the body 
(DELLE CHIAJE, HUSCHKE, RATHKE). On its dorsal surface lies a 
canal, which is closed at its termination backwards, becomes narrower 
forwards and ends in a long proboscis. This part is, according to 
QUATREFAGES, the proper intestinal canal, which consequently has 
no anus. HUSCHKE supposed it to be an organ of propagation 
(testis ?) and the proboscis an external copulative organ ; hence the 



224 CLASS vn. 

name Notospermus, which he gave to the worm examined by him. 
The Nemertini appear, according to E.ATHKE and QUATREFAGES, to 
have the sexes distinct, and the organs of propagation (testes, ovaria) 
consist of blind saccules, which lie beneath the integument longitu- 
dinally, upon the wide canal already described. There are three 
blood-vessels running longitudinally, two on the sides and more 
towards the ventral surface, and one on the dorsal surface, which 
divides anteriorly into two branches which pass into the lateral 
vessels. The nervous system consists of two head-ganglia united by 
a transverse cord, from which (besides other nervous branches) two 
very notable nerves arise, which run longitudinally backwards, 
along the sides of the body.

ORDER II. Suctoria. 

Body annulate, without setas, terminated by a prehensile cavity 
posteriorly or at both extremities. External branchiae none. 

Family III. Hirudinea. (The characters of the order are also 
;hose of the single family.) 

The family of the blood-suckers (leeches) is formed from the genus 
Hirudo L. These animals are able to convert the anterior extremity 
of the body into a suctorial cavity, or have there, as at the posterior 
extremity, a round suctorial disc. They creep along the ground, by 
affixing this sucking apparatus and by alternately contracting and 
extending the body. They swim with a serpentine and sinuous 
bending of the body, which is effected with much velocity.

This animal lays its eggs on water-plants (Stratiotes aloldes) and continues 
to sit thereon. The eggs also attain their development even when the mother 
is driven away, but are then frequently affected and spoilt by confervas. These 
eggs are thin-skinned vesicles in which numerous yelk-spheres, 15 to 30, 
are contained, and from which a corresponding number of young are 
developed.

Clepsine the number does not exceed six ; the arrangement of the eyes is 
in two rows longitudinally which meet forwards, just as in the six-eyed 
Clepsines; the blood also is white.

as SAVIGNY says, (CuviER doubts and MOQUIN-TANDON denies it,) then it does not 
belong to this order. LATREILLE places it near the genus Arenicola.

8vo. Tab. i. fig. i according to KNOLZ it is this species especially which 
is used in Vienna and brought there from Hungary 1 . 

Hirudo medicinalis is the most useful species of Leech (sangsue, leech, 
Blutegel), which almost everywhere in Europe lives in fresh water, especially 
in ponds, marshes and canals, and in winter, rolled up annularly, conceals 
itself in the mud. This animal lives on the blood of animals (vertebrate and 
invertebrate) exclusively; the jaws serve to wound and to penetrate the skin. 
The first segment of the body, which also is occasionally parted by a trans- 
verse stripe, has a semilunar form and is not closed beneath. It can extend 
itself as an upper lip for feeling or bend itself downwards to cover the 
mouth. The ten black eye-spots are arranged in form of a horse-shoe on 
the back-side of the head ; the first on the first segment, the two next on 
the third, and the two last on the sixth ring of the body. The organs of 
propagation of the leech are by different writers determined very differently, 
whilst, however, the latest investigations (especially of H. MECKEL, 
MUELLER'S Archiv. 1844, s. 476 480) bring us back to the generally 
received opinion of former times. According to it, nine pairs of round 
vesicles of a white colour are testes, (TREVIRANUS thought they must be 
held to be ovaries, Zeitschr. fur Physiol. iv. 2, 1832, s. 159 167). By 
means of short transverse tubules these vesicles are connected with a com- 
mon canal which runs at each side of the body ; this canal goes forward 
into a structure which is white and consists of many convolutions (the 
epididymis or the seminal vesicle). From each of these two seminal 
vesicles arises a, short vessel (vas ejaculatorium), which runs to the spherically 
widened sheath of the penis : the penis can be everted outwards through 
an opening in the twenty-fourth ring of the body. In the fifth ring 
behind this is seen the second sexual opening, that of the female parts ; it 
leads to a wide vagina (uterus, according to BOJANUS) which, by means of 
a tube that divides forwards into two branches, is connected with two 
small ovaries or vesicles filled with granular bodies. These two ovaries lie 
between the seminal vesicles and the vagina. The impregnation in Leeches 
is mutual. The Leech lays eggs, or rather capsules, in which eggs 
are contained, 5 16 in number. These capsules or cocoons are three- 
fourths of an inch long, oval and surrounded with a spongy or frothy 
substance, and filled with a brown albuminous fluid. The germs appear as 
round discs ; these minute yelks grow by means of the surrounding 
albumen, which is absorbed by a structure which closely resembles a funnel- 
shaped oesophagus, and is already visible on the germ when only half a line 
in size (E. H. WEBER in MECKEL'S Archiv. 1828, s. 366 418, MUELLER'S 
Archiv. 1846, 8.428 434).

It moves like a geometrical caterpillar ; on the back-side of the cephalic

Beitrdge zur Anat. u. Physiol. der Na'iden; MUELLER' sArchiv. 1846, 
s. 406, &c. Besides the propagation by eggs, these animals are also 
multiplied by spontaneous division. The most complete observations 
on this point relate to Na'is proboscidea. In the last joint of a 
simple Na'is (which MUELLER calls Jung-fer Na'id, Virgin Na'is) a 
young Na'is with eye-spots is gradually developed; it grows and 
remains connected with the mother : sometimes on this a second or 



230 CLASS VIT. 

third daughter is found to be developed, which always arises more 
forward (the last is the oldest, that which first came into being), 
and ordinarily the first daughter already possesses the rudiment of 
a little daughter before she separates herself; the vessels, the in- 
testinal canal, the nervous cord run uninterruptedly through these 
united animals ; at length the united or compound animal is broken, 
and the eldest daughter (herself already a mother) separates herself, 
after the mother-nais has made frequent strokes to and fro with 
her tail. On the eggs of the Ndidce see DUGES Ann. des Sc. nat. xv. 
pp. 322 324. Six or seven eggs are enclosed in a common capsule, 
a grey-coloured vesicle of f line in diameter. 

[From later observations, as those of LEUCKART and SCHULTZE 
referred to above, the process of non-sexual multiplication does not 
appear to be quite so simple as here described. The first and all- 
important step is the development of a bud between two rings 
nearly in the middle of the length of the body; so that this now 
consists of three portions, the anterior, the posterior, and the inter- 
vening bud. All the three become distinct individuals, the first, 
by developing its tail, the last its head, and the bud the head- 
segments and anal portion in the same order of succession as in 
development from the egg. Previous to the separation of these 
three worms a new bud is usually formed in front of the middle 
worm, and in front of it a third bud, &c., so that sometimes a chain 
of many connected individuals is met with which all receive nutri- 
ment (introduced by the mouth of the anterior member of the 
chain) from the intestinal canal common to them all. This process 
appears to have been observed in other families also (Aniphitritce, 
Nereidce), but would seem in all to be limited to the period pre- 
ceding the sexual development.]

The setse are short and rigid, in every ring 8, on each side two 
pairs, so that eight rows run longitudinally on the body, four laterally, 
and four beneath ; in Hypogceon SAV. there is moreover another 
row of single hairs in the middle of the back. The intestinal canal 
is straight, with a membraneous pyriform proventriculus and a round 
or spherical muscular stomach ; behind the stomach it is divided by 
many transverse folds into blind pouches, which further back are 
less developed, where also the intestinal canal becomes smaller 
though on the whole it is wide throughout. In the interior of the 
canal on the dorsal side is a band, which begins a little behind the 
stomach, at this anterior end, as also at the posterior, runs to a 
point, and consists of two membranes, of which the external is 
yellow, the internal white ; intestinum in intestino WILLIS, typhlo- 
sole MORREN. This enigmatical part is probably a duplication of 
the membrane of the intestine, an internal mesentery (MORREN) ; it 
may be compared with the valvular membrane of certain sharks *. 
To the sexual organs belong in the first place three pairs of grey- 
yellow saccules which are situated in the anterior part of the body 
(in the common large earth-worm, Lumbricus agrieola HOFFMEISTER, 
in the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth ring), and of which the 
posterior pair is the largest. These parts are usually considered to 
be ovaries, but STEENSTRUP, who here also denies Hermaphroditism, 
supposes them to be testes in which the seed is formed with the 
spermatozoa in cells, that may be readily mistaken for eggs. 
H. MECKEL maintains that these organs are in all individuals testes, 
and says, that the ovaria, intimately conjoined with them, lie like 
a brown-yellow lobe on each of these saccules. Four small vesicles, 
resembling barley-corns, placed more laterally (two on each side), 
contain in the pairing season a white fluid with spermatozoa free 
and developed : by most writers they have been signalised as the

testes ; STEENSTRUP on the contrary thinks that they ought not to be 
considered to be the parts where the seed is formed, but where it is 
collected (as seminal vesicles in the male subject, as bur see copulatrices 
in the female). The efferent ducts of these vesicles open externally, 
according to SAVIGNY ; but later writers have failed to discover the 
openings ; rather are they in connexion with the efferent ducts of 
the yellow saccules ; these ducts fall at length into a common canal 
011 each side backwards and end with two openings at the fifteenth 
or sixteenth ring of the body. At the origin of these two canals lie 
two small irregular saccules, covered by a thin and glistening mem- 
brane, which according to DUGES and STEENSTRUP are filled with 
many convolutions of the efferent canal and form the passage of the 
yellow saccules to the straight part of the canal which runs back- 
wards \ Earth-worms are oviparous, not viviparous ; they pair 
during the whole Summer, especially by night, when they creep 
from the earth ; but how impregnation is effected, is not yet suffi- 
ciently explained, since the apertures of the sexual organs are not 
brought immediately together. The anterior portions of the two 
worms lie next each other, but with the heads in opposite directions 
(see in MOREEN 1. 1. Tab. xxvn). Thus the part named by WILLIS 
Clitellum (saddle) in each of the two worms lies towards the place 
where the sexual openings of the other worm are found. This cli- 
tellum is a round swelling of the body which occupies from six to 
nine rings (in Lumbricus agricola from the 29th to the 36th or from 
the 31st to the 38th ring), and which during the time of copulation 
is more strongly developed, and in young individuals is entirely 
wanting.

middle of the body, with a double row at the sides of fasciculi of 
dorsal setae. Head not distinct; eyes and jaws none.

transverse folds, incrassated forwards, becoming smaller backwards, 
without setas or other appendages behind the last pair of branchiae. 
Mouth terminal supplied with a proboscis retractile, papillose.

and MILNE EDWARDS, Ann. des Sc. nat. Tom. 30, 1833, PI. 22, fig. 8. 
This species has thirteen pairs of gills. It lives in deep canals excavated in 
the sea-sand, which the worm forms with its head, whilst the sand is 
swallowed and passed through the intestinal canal ; this worm is flesh- 
coloured, sometimes blackish (Arenicola carbonaria LEACH), and exudes a 
yellow fluid on being touched. Fishermen use it as bait to catch shell-fish 
with the hook. Arenicola branchialis AUD. and EDW. 1. 1. fig. 13, has nine- 
teen or twenty pairs of gills, and is smaller than the former. Arenicola 
Bcechii RATHKE, Fauna Norwegens, p. 181, Tab. viu. f. 19 22, differs from 
the former species by the much more numerous gills and by the rings, 
which lie behind the last pair of gills, possessing bundles of hairs ; also the 
anterior part of the body is not incrassated like the former species. It 
seems, therefore, that this species should form a sub-genus. 

It seems that the genus Scalibregma RATHKE ought to be added 
to the Arenicolse : it has four pairs of arborescent branchiae (in the 
fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh segment) with a proboscis not warty ;

to some, to be a myriapod insect ; the English author who first made it 
known, considered it to be a mollusc. MILNE EDWARDS, on anatomical 
grounds, defends its reception into this class ; Ann. des Sc. nat. sec. SeY. 
XVIII. Zoolog. pp. 126 128. Branchice are not present, if the conical 
rudiments of feet are not to be considered as respiratory organs.

Kudiments of feet with cirrus usually single; branchiae either none 
distinct or resembling cirri or lobes adhering to the 'base of the feet. 

This small group, regarded by AUDOUIN and MILNE EDWARDS as 
a distinct family, contains imperfect ringed worms, which in part 
belong to the Nereids of former writers. Where no special gills are 
present, the cirri appear to serve for respiration.

divided into rings and which have feet consisting of different joints, 
into a single class, that of Insects. Together with the class of 
Kinged- Worms they make up one of the four principal groups into

248 CLASS viii. 

which Cuvier, as stated above (p. 33), divided the entire Animal 
Kingdom. We allude to the Type of Articulate Animals, which 
may be separated into two divisions. The first division includes 
articulate animals without jointed feet (apoda, the Annulata), the 
other articulate animals with feet (Condylopoda] . Again, articulate 
animals with limbs (Insects of LINNAEUS) are divided into three 
classes, of which the first, immediately to be treated of, retains the 
name of Insects; the two other classes, those of the Arachnids and 
of the Crustaceans, comprehend those animals which LINNJEUS con- 
sidered as wingless Insects. 

Insects (in the narrower meaning of modern systematic Zoology) 
are mostly provided with wings ; but the presence of these organs 
of motion does not constitute the character of the class. That is to 
be sought for in the head distinct from the trunk, to which two 
antennae are attached, and in the Respiration by means of air-canals 
distributed internally through the body and generally divided into 
very fine branches. The first of these characters distinguishes the 
Insects from the Arachnids in which the head and thorax form a 
single piece, and which have no antennas, the other distinguishes 
them from the Crustaceans, whose respiratory organs are gills or 
other external appendages. 

The names Insecta, notched animals, and in Greek evro^a, have 
all the same meaning. From the last is derived the word Entomo- 
logy (Insect- Science). 

The species belonging to this class are very numerous : in this 
respect no other class can be compared with Insects. In treating 
therefore of this class we must keep within strict limits, that we may 
not too greatly extend our work in the estimation of those who take 
less interest in this special part. 

We will first describe the external structure of these creatures a 
little more precisely The body of the six-footed Insects, which 
make up by far the largest portion of this class, is separated into 
three parts : head, trunk, and abdomen. On the head, besides the 
parts about the mouth, the antennae and eyes are distinguished. 

By Antennce are understood moveable jointed threads, which, 
unconnected with the oral organs, are attached to the head, usually 
close to the eyes. The number of joints is very different; in But- 
terflies, for instance, very large, in Beetles, mostly eleven, &c. All 
insects in the perfect condition or last period of life have two 



INSECTS. 249 

antennae. Their relative size is very different. Sometimes as in 
Locustce, they exceed the length of the body, in others again they 
are very short and almost concealed beneath the eyes. The form 
likewise is different : the antennae are said to \>z filiform when they 
are thin and of the same thickness throughout : clavate when they 
have a knob at the end formed of thicker joints, as in butterflies 
(Papiliones) , &c. 

The eyes (oculi) are either simple or compound. The simple 
eyes are named eye-points (ocelli, stemmata) : they look like smooth 
shining points placed usually in a triangle behind the larger eyes ; 
they are seen in Bees, Wasps, &c. The larger eyes are composed 
of numerous six-sided facettes, and are occasionally of such magni- 
tude (as in Diptera, Libellulce), as to meet, the head seeming to 
consist almost entirely of these two eyes. In some instances the 
number of facettes is surprisingly great: LEEUWENHOECK counted 
8000 in the eye of a fly, STRAUS nearly 8820 in that of a cockchafer 1 . 

The oral apparatus (organa cibaria, Trophi) consist of six 
principal parts, of which four are in pairs and move transversely, 
whilst two face each other above and below. Of these last the 
uppermost is the upper lip (labrum) : it is horny and fixed by a 
joint transversely to the most anterior part of the head. The part 
of the head to which the upper lip is fastened is named head-shield 
(clypeus, in French chaperon). The undermost part, facing the other, 
is named the under lip (labiwn): it closes the mouth below: is 
composed of two parts of which the inferior and more rigid is named 
chin (mentum), and the superior,' generally membraneous, tongue 
(ligida). Sometimes the ligula has two lateral lobes (paraglossce) . 
The remaining four parts are known as upper and under jaws. The 
upper jaws (mandibulce) are two, placed immediately beneath the 
upper lip: they move transversely from within outwards, and are 
often very hard. The under jaws (maxilla?) are ordinarily softer: 
are placed beneath the mandibles, and also move laterally, but are 
less serviceable for cutting the food small than for holding it in the 
mouth and conveying it to the gullet to be swallowed. In the 
Orthoptera there is a membraneous valve which is fastened to the 
maxilla. It is called the helmet (galea) of the lower jaw. 

In addition to these principal parts there are also feelers (palpi, 

1 See plate xx. of SWAMMERDAM'S^/;^ der natuur, where the simple and com- 
pound eyes of a bee are figured. 



250 CLASS Vlll. 

antennulce), jointed threads, attached to the under lip (palpi labiales, 
s. poster 'tores), and to the under jaw (palpi maxillares). The upper 
jaws in Insects are not provided with palps. 

In masticating Insects, as Beetles, Locusts, &c., the parts of the 
mouth, that have been described, may be best and most readily- 
observed. In those which feed by sucking fluids the structure is in 
appearance very different; yet even here it may be observed that 
nature remains true to her plan, and that she has provided the 
suckers not with different but with modified oral parts. We are 
indebted to the illustrious SAVIGNY for the knowledge of that plan 1 . 

The sucking Insects possess oral organs which are named Tongue, 
Beak, Sucker and Snout. 

The Butterflies ( Glossata FABR.) afford an example of what has 
been called tongue, or spiral tongue (lingua, lingua spiralis). It is 
a canal, occasionally of great length, composed of two laminoe which 
are corneous or membraneous, on the inside excavated and round 
externally. When at rest it is rolled up and concealed between two 
palps. This was almost the entire amount of what was known of 
the oral parts of Butterflies. But SAVIGNY pointed out in addition 
two minute upper jaws, placed at some distance from each other, and 
little, if at all, adapted for motion or mastication. The upper lip is 
small and membraneous. The laminae of the tongue, as LATREILLE 2 
had already shewn, are in fact nothing else than greatly elongated 
and extended lower jaws. Their base is united to the head and upper 
lip, and bears a palp composed of two or three joints. The two larger 
palps which include the tongue and conceal it when at rest are 
seated upon a triangular horny under lip. 

The case is similar with the suctorial apparatus of the Hemiptera, 
(Bugs, Gicadce, &c.) named beak (rostrum). It consists of a horny 
sheath (vagina) in which setas are contained (setce rostelli), that at 
first sight appear to be three in number. The two lateral setae are 
elongated upper jaws: the hair in the middle is double, and consists 
of two similarly elongated and united under jaws: the under lip, 
usually jointed, forms the sheath. In the same way in Diptera 
(Flies, &c.) the under lip forms the snout (proboscis) . In its interior

are setae, like as in the beak, which form the sucker (haustellum). 
A triangular upper lip covers the basal piece of the beak in Hemi- 
ptera, as it does that of the snout in Diptera. 

To the head succeeds the trunk or thorax. This part consists 
of three pieces, of which each bears a pair of feet. The first ring is 
named Prothorax, the second Mesothorax, the third MetatJwrax. In 
four-winged Insects the anterior wings are placed on the middle 
piece, the posterior wings on the hinder piece. The wings of Di- 
ptera are placed on the mesothorax. The inferior surface of the 
trunk is called breast (pectus), on which there is sometimes fixed a 
pointed elongated appendage, the breast-bone (sternum). The 
shield (scutellum) is a part found on the upper part of the thorax 
behind (at the mesothorax) stretching between the wings 1 . 

The feet are attached on the inferior surface of the body : in the 
hexapod Insects every ring of the thorax carries a pair. Between 
the sternum and epimeron is an articular cavity (acetabulum) . The 
first joint is termed hip (coxa, condylus) ; sometimes there is a small 
and very moveable piece between the epimeron and coxa (trochan- 
terium, trochantin AUDOUIN), but it is usually wanting or has coa- 
lesced with the coxa. The second joint is termed Trochanter, it is 
very small and mostly annular. Then comes the thigh (femur), the 
stoutest, and often also the longest joint of the leg. To it succeeds 
the shank (tibia) more slender, and in general flattened laterally. 
Last is the foot (tarsus), consisting of many joints placed in a line 
like the small bones of our fingers. The number of these joints is 
different in different families; occasionally, in certain coleopterous 



1 The upper surface of the thorax (dorsum of AUDOUIN) may be named notum, the 
under surface sternum, and just as the entire thorax is divided into three rings, so also 
a pronotum and prosternum, mesonotum and mesosternum, metanotum and metasternum 
may be distinguished. Moreover, each ring of the thorax consists of definite special parts, 
which, however, are not distinctly seen in every ring, whilst some coalesce with others, 
or by the greater development of others are suppressed ; these parts are a sternum on 
the under surface, on either side an episternum as a chief part, and behind this an 
epimeron; and, finally, on the upper four pieces placed behind each other, to which 
AUDOUIN gives the names of prcescutum, scutum, scutellum and post- scutellum; thus 
there are properly three scuteUa, but what is usually named scutellum is a part of the 
mesonotum; at the sides of the scutum the wings are attached. Comp. on this interesting 
subject AUDOUIN, Recherches anatomiques sur le thorax des Animaux articules, Ann. des

insects it is not the same in the first two pairs of feet and in the last 
pair, yet in most Insects the number is five. In some coleopterous 
insects, the penultimate joint is extremely short, and was in conse- 
quence overlooked formerly. The last joint of the foot usually ends 
with two booklets, or claws : in addition, its inferior surface is often 
covered with fine hair, to attach it to small inequalities which even 
the smoothest objects present. Sometimes these hairs are set on 
two or three delicate membraneous appendages (cushions, pulmlli] 
which the Insects mould to the surfaces over which they run. In 
this way flies can move upwards on mirrors, or with head down- 
wards on smooth ceilings, as is seen daily 1 . 

Besides the feet, wings also are placed on the thorax of volant 
insects : on the meso- and meta-thorax, as stated above, when there 
.are four: when only two, on the meso-thorax. They are set on the 
dorsal surface, and may be compared with the elytra or squamce in 
Aphrodita: with the wings of vertebrate animals (Birds, Bats), which 
are only modifications of the anterior limbs, they have only similarity 
of use : they are not modified feet : they exist contemporaneously 
with feet and are independent of them 2 . Wings are membraneous, 
arid, usually transparent, composed of two laminae grown together 
at the edges ; these laminae are expansions of the skin like the 
parachute extended between the fingers of Bats and between the 
ribs of flying Lizards (Draco). Canals (improperly named Veins 
or Nerves) run between the laminge, and are more or less numerous, 
more or less branched. These veins are branches of the air-tubes, 
which lie between two wide horny semicanals of the upper and 
under laminae that compose the wing. In some species the males 
alone have wings. Bees, Wasps, Butterflies, &c. have four wings. 
In the Diptera, besides the wings there are two parts which may 
be considered as traces of hind- wings, called poisers (halter es] ; 
they consist of a little button with a pedicle, and are often covered by 
a membraneous scale (squama halterum) 3 . The anterior wings are

in some insects harder, horny and opaque ; they are then called wing- 
covers (elytra), and the under- wings, usually larger, are when at 
rest folded transversely beneath the covers and concealed (as in 
Beetles, Coleoptera). In other instances the under wings disappear, 
and the wing-covers coalesce by their inner edges (elytra coadu- 
nata). Hemelytra is the name given to the anterior wings, when 
horny or coriaceous at the base but membraneous towards the apex 
(in Hemiptera, as Water-scorpions, Nepa cinerea, &c.) 

The hinder-body (abdomen) constitutes the third portion of the 
body of Insects, and usually consists of nine rings, of which 
however the last are in some instances so much concealed, and in 
others so small or so fused with the preceding, that they seem to 
be entirely wanting. As the organs of sense have their seat in 
the head, and those of motion in the thorax, so do the principal 
organs of vegetative or organic life reside in the abdomen. 

The digestive organs present differences according to the 
Orders and Families. Here the comparative length of the intes- 
tinal canal does not always depend, as in vertebrate animals, upon 
the nature of the food, and many species that live on animal 
substances have a longer and more convoluted canal than others 
which live on plants; in Grasshoppers for instance (G-rylli, 
Locustce) it is almost straight, though these insects live exclusively 
on vegetable food. In those Insects whose body consists of 
uniform rings (as the myriapods) and in vermiform larvae of Insects 
with a complete Metamorphosis, the intestinal canal is straight, or 
makes only few and inconspicuous curves. The intestine has the 
greatest length in proportion to the body in certain Coleoptera and 
Hemiptera. In the last it is at least twice, often four or five times 
the length of the body (ex. gr. in Lygceus apterus FABR.) ; in 
Cicada orni the intestinal canal is about ten times as long as the 
body 1 . Amongst Coleoptera the Scarabceides, to which the common 
cockchafer belongs, are remarkable for their very long and tortuous 
intestinal canal, which in Copris lunaris measures ten or twelve 
times the length of the body. 

The membranes or coats of the intestinal canal are, first, a thin 
covering, which without sufficient reason has been compared with

the peritoneal covering of the intestines in vertebrate animals; 
next, a muscular coat of longitudinal and transverse fibres ; then a 
white, smooth membrane, a layer of areolar tissue probably corre- 
sponding to the tunica propria of the intestine in vertebrates, but 
which is often beset with minute glands in transverse rows : and 
lastly the innermost membrane, an Epithelium, that occasionally, as 
in the muscular stomach of the Orthoptera, is found hard and horny, 
forming the teeth or sharp plates with which the stomach is armed. 
In the intestinal canal of Insects several parts are to be 
distinguished : but it is much to be wished that writers in the 
names given to them had been careful to preserve greater uni- 
formity. The first part is the oesophagus, it has often an expan- 
sion named crop (ingluvies) ; next follows a muscular stomach 
(ventriculus musculosus, der Kaumagen, le gesier, the gizzard) ; it is 
found in the Orthoptera and amongst the Coleoptera in the genera 
Staphylinus, Dytiscus, and the family of the Carabici 1 , and is 
remarkable for the great development of the innermost coat, for 
the projecting plates, teeth or hooklets of corneous tissue which 
serve for bruising the food ; it is usually folded and has a round, 
more or less spherical, form 2 . Then comes a long cylindrical 
stomach in which the proper digestion proceeds. LEON DUFOUR 
names it ventricule chylifique ; RAMDOHR calls it simply the sto- 
mach, which name appears to me to be sufficient and preferable to 
the other. This organ is always present, and beneath its termina- 
tion the vasa urinaria (of which hereafter) are always inserted 3 . 
To this succeeds a longer or shorter, sometimes (as in the Hemi- 
ptera) a very short canal, the small intestine (intestinum tenue), 
which is continued into the short large intestine (intest. crassum), 
having occasionally a caecum or expanded portion when the con- 
nexion takes place obliquely and at the side 4 . 



1 LEON DUFOUR has also discovered a muscular stomach in Tomicus typographic . 
Ann. des Sc. not. iv. p. 108. 

2 RAMDOHR names it Faltenmagen (plicated stomach, omasus), a very ill-chosen name. 

3 MARCEL DE SERRES considered the stomach to be duodenum ; in that case many 
insects must have no stomach at all. The name of Crop (jabot succenturie) by which 
STRAUS denotes this part in the Cockchafer is not explicable. 

4 We are indebted to LEON DUFOUR for most of the investigations of the intes- 
tinal canal in Insects. They were preceded by those of RAMDOHR, who published a 
work on the subject, (Abhandlungen iiber die Verdauungswerkzeuge der Insecten, mit 
30 Kupfertafeln, Halle, i8n, 4to). 



INSECTS. 255 

The intestinal canal of Insects is connected to the other parts 
of the body partly by a large quantity of fat (the adipose body, of 
which below), and partly by numerous branches of air-tubes, and 
so retained in its place. 

In very many Insects Salivary Glands are present; they are 
placed at the commencement of the intestinal canal. In Coleoptera, 
for the most part, they are wanting; RAMDOHR found them in 
Curculio ( GryptorJiynchus] lapathi, LEON DuFOUR, besides in other 
Curculwnida, also in Blaps, Diaperis, Mordella and some other 
Coleoptera; moreover in the other orders of Insects they are 
present in by far the greater number of Families, probably in all 
Orthoptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Diptera and Myriapoda. 
Amongst the Neuroptera they are wanting in Libellula and Ephe- 
mera, amongst the Hemiptera in Aphides. It is very remarkable, 
and not easily explicable, that in Panorpa amongst the Neuroptera 
the female has no salivary glands, or more correctly only small 
rudiments of them, whilst the male has them largely developed 1 . 
They have here the form of long convoluted canals (three on each 
side), which towards the end are turned upwards, and becoming 
thinner terminate by blind extremities. This form of blind con- 
voluted canals occurs also in the salivary glands of some other 
insects, ex. gr. of the Lepidoptera; but it is by no means general, 
for in the Hymenoptera and Orthoptera these organs appear commonly 
as blind sacs grouped in clusters. Microscopic investigation has 
demonstrated in these salivary vessels and glands, as in other 
glands, a layer of epithelial cells with nuclei 2 . 

Below the inferior orifice of the stomach in Insects very fine 
vessels are implanted, the so-called Malpighian vessels, which in 
former times were generally looked upon as organs for the prepara- 
tion of bile (vasa hepatica] an opinion still maintained by LriON 
DUFOUR, OwEN 3 and other writers. It is, on the other hand, the 



1 Our meritorious countryman BRANTS first made this interesting observation,

made known by LEON DUFOUR (Memoires presents a I' A cad. royale des Sc. vn. 1841, 
PP- 582, 583, PL n, fig. 169,) who overlooked, however, the rudimentary salivary 
glands in the female.

opinion of most writers of the present day, that they correspond to 
the kidneys of the higher animals, whence the term used above 
p. 254, (vasa urinaria) for these vessels. Besides other grounds for 
this opinion, it is supported by chemical investigation 1 . These 
vessels appear to be present in all Insects, with the exception of 
Aphidii amongst the Hemiptera, where it has not been possible to 
find a trace of them. Their number is very different, and seems 
to be on the whole inversely proportional to their length ; they are 
short and very numerous, more than twenty, in the Hymenoptera and 
Orthoptera, and in Libellula and Ephemera amongst the Neuroptera. 
Here they are arranged in a ring round the intestinal canal which 
they perforate, whilst at the free extremity they terminate coecally. 
In Gry llotalpa and AchetaY ABE. they fall into a common canal before 
opening into the intestine. In the remaining Insects there are 
usually only four or two of them present (Diptera, Hemiptera, 
many Coleoptera), or six, as in other Coleoptera (the Heteromerata, 
Tetramerata, and Trimerata). When there are only two, they 
form a loop on each side of the intestinal canal, which seems to 
arise from the fusion of two vessels ; and so open by four termi- 
nations into the canal. In those Coleoptera which have six, they 
are also attached to the inferior extremity of the intestinal canal 
(the Rectum) , but do not open into it there ; they run upwards as 
very fine vessels between the coats of the intestine and terminate 
blindly 2 . 

If we consider these organs as Kidneys it becomes uncertain 
whether Insects have a Liver ; for the idea that these vessels may 
represent at once both Kidneys and Liver (whence it has been 
proposed to name them vasa urino-biliaria] is not, as appears to 
me, the result of comparative investigation either anatomical or

physiological, and would never have been entertained but for the 
attempt to reconcile two conflicting views, and which ought always 
to be distrusted when it interferes with more extended enquiry. 
But if we suppose an organ answering to the liver to be alto- 
gether wanting in insects, then it must be proved that the separa- 
tion of bile is more important in the animal economy than the 
excretion of urea, before an argument can be borrowed therefrom 
against the function ascribed to the Malpighian vessels. We do 
not forget that by respiration and the elaboration of bile the 
quantity of carbon in the living body is diminished, and that from 
be large development of the respiratory organs in insects the 
xcretory office of the liver is in a great measure dropped *, 
sTevertheless it is still highly probable that parts, whose function 
grees with that of a liver, are not altogether absent in Insects, 
n the first place we might here refer to the great quantity of 
it the adipose body situated between the skin and the intes- 
ne, which invests every organ and is of very great extent, more 
specially in larvae whose respiration is less perfect; the carbon 
nd hydrogen which in other instances is combined with oxygen to 
uit the body by respiration, here forms that provision of com- 
ustible matter so necessary in the animal economy for the support 
f respiration, especially in the case of Insects, which as Nymphs 
ike scarcely any food. Since then this production of fat exerts 
le same influence on the composition of the fluids as the separa- 
xm of bile, it is not to be considered as a proceeding entirely 
rbitraiy if some recognise in the adipose body an analogon of 
liver 2 . The adipose body consists of a multitude of minute 
acs or vesicles bound together by air-tubes which spread them- 
slves as a fine network on their surface. In the second place, coecal 
ppendages are seen below the muscular stomach in the Orthoptere 
sight in Mantis, six in Gryllus, two in Acketa) which involuntarily

ably secrete a fluid that performs the office of the bile in diges- 
lon 3 . In other insects, finally, as in the Carabici among the

s That these blind appendages arise from an immediate extension (protrusion) of the

258 CLASS viii. 

Coleoptera the entire stomach (ventricule chylifique DlTFOUii) is beset 
with numberless conical or filiform saccules, giving a flocculent 
aspect to its external surface. It may be, that these parts, whose 
office was formerly supposed erroneously to be the absorption of 
nutrient fluid from the intestine, prepare the bile : but it seems 
more probable that they serve to separate the gastric juice 1 . 

The Heart of Insects has the form of a long vessel that 
terminates behind by a blind extremity and lies above the intes- 
tinal canal on the dorsal surface. This dorsal vessel becomes 
narrower forwards, after it has curved slightly downwards. The 
smaller part may be considered to be an artery, whilst the wider 
posterior portion answers more closely to the heart of other crea- 
tures. In this posterior part are different lateral openings, mostly 
eight or nine pairs : and in front of each opening is a valve formed 
by a duplicature inwards of the wall. In the diastole of the heart 
the blood flows into it between two sets of valves, of which the 
posterior pair come into apposition, whilst the anterior lie folded 
against the wall and so permit the onward motion of the blood. 
Systole and diastole succeed each other alternately, moving along 
the length of the dorsal vessel from behind forwards. SWAMMER- 
DAM long ago, and STRAUS in more recent times noticed in the 
dorsal vessel longitudinal and transverse muscular fibres, the latter 
forming the innermost layer. Surrounding the heart is a space which 
some writers consider to be a sinus venosus; it is covered by lateral 
muscles, flat, and of triangular form, which have their broad base 
towards the heart and fix it in its position (les ailes du Cceur o: 
LYONET). From behind, the blood flows through the lateraj 
openings into the heart, and moves forwards ; from before, it flow; \ 
from the aorta between the organs, especially along the course o i 



organs. Mim. prtsentes, vn. p. 302. In Leucopsis also amongst the ffymenoptera tw 
such blind saccules are met with ; LEON DDFOUR, ibid. p. 524. 

1 The great uncertainty which prevails concerning the interpretation of tl 
secretory organs in the lower animals, is a necessary consequence of the fact that tl 
selfsame secretion, as we learn from comparative anatomy, may be effected by ve} 
differently formed glands ; see ,T. MUELLER'S Handb. der PhysioL, n. Buch, Abschn. 
(l. Bd., s. 457, 3fte Aufi.) Chemical investigation alone can here afford light, ai

munications.

the air-tubes, in regular streams backwards. These streams of 
blood on the outside of the heart were first observed by CARUS 
twenty years ago in the three fin-shaped caudal processes of the 
larva of Agrion / afterwards he observed a similar motion of fluid 
in the imperfect wings of the Nymphs ; the blood-globules (accord- 
ing to many, rather according to VERLOREN, the fat-globules) , which 
swimming in a clear fluid indicate the direction of the current. 
The later observations of various authors, on transparent larvae 
principally, have ascertained the phenomenon in Insects of every 
order and it may therefore be confidently accepted as general. A 
question which requires further investigation for its solution is 
this, whether the circulation is effected in vessels, as ex. gr. NEW- 
PORT and BOWERBANK believe, or in free spaces between the 
organs, without special walls. The writers who maintain the 
.atter opinion, allege that the Aorta has an open termination in 
the Head. In the Myriapoda, besides the dorsal vessel, there are 
still others present; amongst which a trunk that lies upon the 
nervous cord in the abdomen, ought to be mentioned. In the 
Butterflies also TREVERANUS discovered on the ventral surface a 
vessel, lying on the nervous cord and running longitudinally, from 
which on each side numerous transverse branches arise 1 . NEW- 
PORT found this vessel in the genus Sphinx, and thinks that the 
blood flows in it backAvards, as it does forwards in the aorta. This 
last author discovered in this same genus, and in certain Coleoptera 
branches from the aorta in the head, but was not able, on account 
of the delicacy of the parts, to follow their further course 2 . 

The Respiratory organs of Insects are their air-canals (trachea) ,

which are usually filled with air by external openings (stigmata}. 
These canals have three coats: an external, loose, transparent 
membrane, in which fibres and scattered points (cell-nuclei) may 
be distinguished ; a middle, composed of a flat, horny, sometimes 
brown or yellow elastic thread rolled spirally : and an inner coat 
which is composed of Mtine, a continuation of the external skin, 
and is thrown off at every moult 1 . Through the elasticity of the 
spiral thread the air-canals are duly kept open : its turns lie close 
to each other, and so the appearance of rings is produced, as in the 
wind-pipe of mammals (this the representation of the trachese of 
Pediculus in SwAMMERDAM, Bill, natur. Tab. I. fig. VII. resem- 
bles too closely) ; but the similarity is only in appearance ; there 
are no absolute rings, but only the turns of a single uninterrupted 
thread. Each branch, arising from a stem, has a new thread, 
whether the branch proceeds laterally from the stem, or two branches 
arise at the end of the stem ; this thread is finer than that of the 
stem, and in the terminal branches is only visible when very 
highly magnified. From being full of air, the canals, when 
Insects are dissected under water, have a silvery splendour, and 
present on account of the extreme fineness of their branching a 
very beautiful appearance to the observer 2 . Usually the air-canals 
divide, like arteries, into continually finer branches. In some 
Insects however there spring from a large stem on every side 
throughout a greater or less extent extremely fine and numerous 
branches (as ex. gr. according to LEON DUFOUR, in Prionus, from 
the double stem which lies between the last stigma of the thorax 
and the first of the abdomen). In Nepa and Ranatra saccules are 
seen in the cavity of the thorax, between which similar fin* 
branches (retia mirabilia) of the air-canals lie, and which are sur- 
rounded by a muscular coat 3 . Care must be taken to distinguish 
these saccules from the sacculated dilatations of the air-canals them- 
selves, which are met with in flying Insects in the last period q 



1 It has not been made out, as far as T know, whether the innermost membrane o 
the air-tubes is present in those insects also which have no stigmata, but gill-plates, 
the larvae of Ephemera, for instance.

possit." De Bombyce, p. 12. Opera om. Tom. II. Londini, 1687, fol.

their life, and which beyond doubt are of service in diminishing 
weight during flight. These dilatations are oval or pear-shaped, and 
occasionally a tubular trachea proceeds anew from their further 
side. In the Apiarice amongst the Hymenoptera, the two lateral 
main trunks of the air-canals in the abdomen are in this way 
converted into large reservoirs of air. 

The stigmata are present in different numbers in the hexapod 
Insects, but it is rare to find more than nine pairs of them; in 
Dytwcus amongst the Coleoptera and in Locusta amongst the 
Ortkoptera there are ten pairs (BiTRMEiSTER Handbuch der Ento- 
mologie I. p. 175). Also in Gryllotalpa I found ten pairs, three in 
the thorax and seven in the abdomen. These air-slits are small, 
generally oblong fissures (like button-holes), often surrounded by a 
horny ring (peritrema) with a cavity behind them which again, by 
a second fissure whose posterior half can be retracted by muscles, 
leads to the air-canals. In other instances there is no peritrema, 
but the stigma is formed by a fissure between two lips, whose 
edges are beset with hairs. Sometimes there are in the cavity of 
the stigma special moveable horny plates (epiglottides STRAUS), 
which can close the entrance of the air-canal that proceeds from it. 
By means of the oblique position of the lips, of which one often 
projects over the other, by means of the narrow opening, and of 
the hair or down on their edge, the entrance of dust or other 
small bodies into the stigmata is prevented, whilst the air alone is 
admitted as through a sieve. From every air-slit, or its cavity 
(vestibule) there arises an air-canal (trachee d'origine STRAUS) 
which divides into numerous branches (in Scolopendra) , or proceeds 
transversely after having given off one or two lateral main-stems. 
These main-stems running along the length of the body, (in most 
Insects there is only one on each side,) receive all the canals that 
spring from the air-slits or fissures, and connect them together. 
! They give off the numerous branches which spread through every 
i part of the body. The distribution of the air-canals after the 
I manner of vessels is interesting ; by such a disposition of the 
respiratory organs in Insects, the atmospheric air has access in 
equal degree to every part of their body *. But it is too much to 



" In nobis et consimilibus sanguinis massct pulmones petit ... in insectis non totn 
fftnyninis moles in pulmones conflult, sed inversa via pulmones ipsi, vasorum ritu, in 



262 CLASS vin. 

conclude from hence that the circulation of blood is unnecessary in 
Insects, and consequently does not exist. The circulation of blood 
has not respect to respiration alone, it is not merely for the con- 
version of venous blood into arterial ; it is necessary that arterial 
blood should circulate that it may serve for nutrition and secretion. 
Many Insects live in water : but of these the greater number 
breathe atmospheric air ; like whales amongst mammals some come 
to the surface of the water for that purpose. But usually there are 
special arrangements for conducting the air, so that the Insect can 
remain under water. This is seen ex. gr. in the larva? of Dtytera, 
which live under water; those of Culex have at the posterior 
part of the body a lateral canal with fine hairs at the orifice ; the 
larvse of Stratiomys have a canal at the end of the abdomen, whose 
orifice is fringed with a circlet of plumose hairs ; the genera Nepa 
and Ranatra have a tail composed of two filaments at whose base 
are two air-slits 1 . These water-insects die in a few hours if the air 
has no access to the water. Other Insects breathe in the water itself, 
that is, they breathe the air that is diffused through the water, as 
fishes do by their gills. Such Insects have no air-slits : the air 
must therefore penetrate the walls of the tracheae, which to that 
end are spread out either in filiform or capillary appendages (in the 
larvae of Gyrinus, of Semblis, the nymphce of Chironomus) or in 
leaf-like plates at one side of the body (Ephemera), or at the 
extremity of the abdomen (Agrion). These parts have been termed 
Gills*; they are not found in perfect Insects. Gills of this sort, 
from which blind air-tubes arise, occur in the rectum of the larva 
of Libellula, as five rows of plumose incised leaflets. From them 
arise six longitudinal steins, of which two, larger than the rest,

1 Figures of Culex in SWAMMERDAM, Bibl. nat. Tab. xxxi. figs. 4, 5 ; of Stratiomys, 
ibid. Tab. xxxix. ; of Nepa, in DUFOUR, 1. 1. The abdomen of Nepa and Ranatra 
has besides three pair of conspicuous, but closed, air-slits, in which very large branches 
of air-tubes terminate with blind ends. 

3 This nomenclature is only in part correct. The proper respiratory organs of 
Insects, the air-tubes, belong to the category of lungs, whether the air penetrates by 
external apertures (stigmata), or the tubes be filled with air from endosmotic action. 
The air in fact is in the inside, and the stream of blood (along the tracheae) on the 
outside, and this relation is just the reverse of that which prevails in gills.

become afterwards the main trunks of the perfect Insect which are 
in connexion with the air-slits 1 . 

Observations have shewn that Respiration in Insects effects the 
same chemical changes of the air, as in higher creatures ; respira- 
tion is more active, the need of air greater and the production of 
carbonic acid more abundant in the perfect Insect than in the 
larva. In the perfect Insect, moreover, respiration is performed 
principally by the air-slits of the thorax, which are larger than 
those of the abdomen, whilst in the larva that function is distri- 
buted more equally amongst all the stigmata. This fact is in 
connexion with the development of the thorax and with the 
mechanism for motion affixed there in the perfect Insect. Accurate 
investigations have shewn that Insects, at least under certain cir- 
cumstances, have a proper ivarmth, and that they can raise the 
temperature of their body remarkably by motion, or by voluntary 
acceleration of respiration 2 . 

The sexes are distinct in all Insects, and the eggs are not 
fertilized, as in fishes, after they are laid, but union of the sexes 
must precede the laying of the eggs if they are to prove fruitful. 
A remarkable peculiarity has been observed in Plant Lice (Aphides),

where a single impregnation suffices for many families in succes- 
sion ; the males are not observed until the end of summer or in 
autumn ; they impregnate the last family, consisting of wingless 
females, which without copulation would be barren. Their eggs 
remain during the winter on branches of trees, and in spring 
produce only female plant-lice which without copulation are prolific 
and viviparous. BONNET, to whom we owe this discovery, found 
that in the space of three months nine successive generations were 
produced without copulation 1 . 

Amongst the Myriapoda the Chilopods have only a single ovary, 
in form of a long sac situated beneath the intestine. In the 
remaining Insects there are two ovaries. Sometimes they have the 
same form of tubes or sacs (Forficula, Ephemera, Stratiomys) ; in 
some flies the sac is very long, rolled spirally like a watch-spring, 
and separated by many transverse partitions into cells 2 . In most 
Insects each ovary consists of a number of tubes (games ovig^res 
LEON DUFOUR). Sometimes these are situated around a sacciform 
dilatation from which the oviduct arises (ovaria baccata), as in 
Meloe L. and Lycus (coleoptera) 3 . Or these tubes are situated 
lengthwise along the origin of oviduct (ovaria ramosa), as in 
Cicada 4 ; sometimes on one side only, like the teeth of a comb, as 
in PJiasma and Tenthredo (Athalia). But in by far the greatest 
number of cases, these tubes are situated at the beginning of the 
oviduct like the leaflets of a digitated leaf, at the end of a common 
stalk (ovaria digitata, fasciculata). Such ovaries are seen in the 
Lepidoptera, where each of them consists of four tubes. The 
number of these tubes is however very different, not only in the 
different orders, but even in the same order, and occasionally in the 
same natural family ; whilst, ex. gr. Bombyx and Xylocopa (Hymen- 
optera) have four, in the Honey-Bee are more than one hundred 5 . In

many Hemiptera heteroptera there are seven, as also in many Cara- 
lici ; the Cockchafer and other Lamellicornia have six, the Stag- 
Beetle (Lucanus cervus) twelve, &c. The length of these tubes is 
different, but on the whole is more marked in proportion as the 
number is fewer, as in the Butterflies ; they contain the eggs in a 
string; the largest and most developed are at the lower end, the 
smaller above. Here the ovarial tubes run out into a fine thread 
which LEON DUFOUR terms Suspensory Ligament, whilst J. 
MUELLER considers the parts to be vessels which connect the ovaries 
with the dorsal vessel. In most instances the threads unite on 
each side to form a cord; in others (in Phasma ex. gr.} they 
proceed separately to the dorsal vessel. 

From the inferior termination of the ovaries proceed two oviducts 
(tuba 3 ), which coalesce to form a common tube beneath the rectum: 
it is ordinarily much shorter than the tuba; in the cockchafer, on the 
contrary, it is longer than these. Different horny plates surround the 
dilated inferior termination of this common tube; it has a sphincter 
muscle to contract it, as well as several others J . Generally it falls, 
with the rectum, into a common cloaca, or it opens beneath and 
in front of the anus. Sometimes the external sexual organs of the 
female, generally seated in the ninth ring of the abdomen, which is 
included and hidden in the eighth, are prolonged into an appendage 
externally. Here belongs the tubular vagina of Flies (vagina tubi- 
formis), in Chrysis, &c. 2 , which is formed of the last abdominal 
rings that can be drawn within each other like an opera-glass. In 
others the vagina is two-valved (vagina bivalvis), as in Locusts 
(Locustce), and projects beyond the last segment of the abdomen as 
an ensiform compressed prolongation. In others there is a per- 
forator borer (terebra) or a sting (aculeus) ; here, besides the bi- 
valved vagina, there is a sharp organ for puncturing, with serrated 
edges, and composed of one or of two horny threads ; when at rest 
the sting is concealed within the abdomen ; it is connected with a 
poison-gland 3 .

Different appendages belong to the common oviduct, or to the 
vagina. Of these one is more constant than the rest, and opens into 
the common oviduct, close to the uppermost part, where this is 
formed from the union of the two tubes. Previous to copulation it 
is empty, but after that act is filled with a white fluid which is the 
seed, as microscopic investigation has demonstrated beyond doubt, 
from the presence of the hair-like spermatozoa in motion. This part, 
generally single, may therefore be called receptaculum seminis. 
Frequently it has an appendage (glandula appendicularis] . In 
many insects there is another vesicle present which, during copula- 
tion, receives the penis (bursa copulatrix,poclie,c,opulatrice AUDOUIN), 
and which in the cockchafer is a large bladder beneath the oviduct. 
In the Butterflies this organ opens externally, and not into the ovi- 
duct, so that there are two sexual orifices, whilst a canal leads from 
the bursa copulatrix to the oviduct, and conducts the seed into the 
receptaculum seminis situated above. There are other vesicles, or 
glands, generally in pairs and situated more behind for the purpose 
of covering the eggs with an adhesive fluid. In the Butterflies 
these are seen as two pyriform vesicles laid transversely with their 
broad bases opposed, which at the other end pass into a very long, 
contorted, blind canal. In a few Insects still other secretory organs 
have been observed, which probably secrete a peculiar odorous 
matter to attract the male 1 . 



On the borer (terebra) in the Cicada, see Do YE 1 RE in Ann. des Sc. nat. 2e Se'rie, vn. 
Zoologie, pp. 193 199, PI. 8, the middle bristle (le poincon DOYERE) works like 
a wedge. 

1 It is difficult to be brief on a subject which has reference to such an important 
difference of organisation, and which, on account of the various views of observers, 
possesses an historical interest. MALPIGHI (de Bombyce) long ago recognised the 
vesicula copulatrix as the organ which receives the penis and gave it the name of 
uterus; often the penis or a part of it is broken off, and remains here after copulation. 
The penis is figured in this part in Sphinx ligustri from a preparation by HUNTER in 
the Catalogue of the Physiological Series of the Museum of the College of Surgeons, 
Vol. V. London, 1840, PI. 67, fig. 8. It was with fluid from this vesicle that HUNTEB 
impregnated artificially the eggs of other butterflies. Phil. Trans. 1792, p. 175 (in 
Bombyx mori) ; an experiment already devised by MALPIGHI, but attempted without 
success. SPALLANZANI, before HUNTER had effected the artificial impregnation of the 
eggs of the silkworm, but with the seed taken directly from the male butterfly, so that 
his experiment does not belong to our present subject (Experiences pour servir a I'ffist. 
de la Gener. Geneve, 1785, 8. p. 223). AUDOUIN has the honour of having been the 
first in our century to direct attention to this subject, whilst previously all these 



INSECTS. 267 

The male individuals amongst Insects have usually two testes, 
though there be occasionally only one, just as in the female there 
may be only one ova-Hum. Such is the case with LithoMus where 
the part has the form of a long tortuous canal. In the Scolopendrce 
proper (Scol. morsitans, &c.) are different oval testes, much extended 
in length, (described improperly by KUTORGA as epididymides) 
which at each pointed extremity send off an efferent canal ; all these 
canals coalesce to form a single canal which is very tortuous and 
widens into a sac below (testiculus KuTORGA 1 ). In Scutigera there 
are two very tortuous canals (testiculi?} present, which begin with 
an oval sacciform expansion, and then pass into a single fine tube, 
of great length and winding right and left with close curves ; this 
tube opens into a canal, which as an arc connects the two efferent 
canals each of which dilates twice into an oval vesicle 2 . In Julus 
there are two long blind tubes, which, connected by transverse 
canals, have the form of a ladder, and to which laterally blind sacs 
are appended ; these sacs may be considered to be testes and the two 
longitudinal canals to be vasa deferentia 3 . 

In the hexapod Insects the parts which prepare the seed are 
always in pairs. There is found indeed in most Lepidoptera and in 
certain Coleoptera (ex. gr. in Ophonns and Harpalus, genera of the 
family of the Carabici) a single testis*, but since two efferent canals 
arise from its lower edge, it is obviously formed by the union of two 



appendages had been confounded together as secreting organs, Ann. desSc. not. II. 1824, 
p. 281. We owe to C. TH. VON SIEBOLD the most complete investigation of this 
subject ; see his Fernere Beobachtungen iiber die Spermatozoa der wirbettosen Thiere, in 
MUELLER'S Archiv. 1837, s. 392 433. If, as VON SIEBOLD assures us, the vesicula 
copulatrix only seldom contains Spermatozoa, and then usually dead ones, it is less to 
be wondered at that the experiments of MALPIGHI failed than that those of HUNTER 
succeeded; they ought to be repeated with better success with the fluid from the 
receptaculum seminis. LEON DUFOUR still persists in considering all these appendages 
as ylandes sebifiques.

which were originally distinct, as at least in Butterflies is placed 
beyond all doubt by the history of development. In many Hymen- 
optera the two testes lie side by side in a common covering (scrotum 
DUFOUR). Sometimes these organs, usually white, are distinguished 
by lively colours (deep red in Papilio brassicce, and in some Hemi- 
ptera, yellow or orange-coloured in some Coleoptera) which depend 
upon the investing membrane. Moreover the structure of the testes 
is very manifold, and, as in glands generally, nature has here solved 
the problem, in a small given space to increase as much as possible 
the secretory surface, in very different ways. The simplest form is 
that of a single blind canal, which is sometimes very tortuous 1 . In 
other cases this blind canal has more the form of a sac, ex. gr. in 
Scutellera, Edessa. Yet they are not always constructed in this 
simple way, when they have externally the form of a single blind 
sac and have also been so described by some writers ; in Libellula, 
for instance, this sac contains a number of small round vesicles 2 . In 
by far the greatest number of Insects each testis consists of a collec- 
tion of different, sometimes very numerous, vesicles, or cylindrical 
canals (capsules seminifiques LEON DUFOUR) terminating blindly, 
which are united in form of a fan, of a star, of an umbel, or in 
bunches, and from which canals arise that afterwards terminate in 
a single efferent canal 3 . This efferent canal forms sometimes at its 
commencement numerous tortuosities, to which the name of epi- 
didymis has been given (as in many Carabici, in Melolontha*, in 
Nepa, &c.). The lowest part has often an expansion 5 to which the 
name of vesicula seminalis has been fitly given. Far less propriety 
is there in giving this name to different blind canals which are met

with in most Insects and which unite with the efferent canal. That 
these parts rather serve to effect special secretions and correspond 
with the prostate and COWPER'S glands in higher creatures is pro- 
bable even from their composite structure ancl great development. 
Hence in some Insects they have been even described as testiculi 
and the true testes as glands of an unknown use, as for instance, by 
SwAMMERDAM in Oryctes nasicornis 1 . In this and other Lamelli- 
cornia (Melolontha, Cetonia) these glands are two tortuous canals, 
which resemble the testiculi of the Carabici. In Hydropliilus piceus 
these parts exceed the testes in circumference. Ordinarily there is 
one pair 2 : often also there are two pairs of these accessory organs 
present; in some are found three or even more pairs. They are 

.ntirely absent only in few Insects (G-ersis, Velia, Ranatra). In 
Libellula they are also wanting 3 ; yet I think it is nearer the 

ruth to say that here they are not connected with the testiculi 

md are present in an unusual situation, which is in agreement with 

he copulation of these animals 4 . From this also it is apparent that 

hese organs are not vesiculce seminales. 

For determining the purpose of the different parts connected 
tvlth the organs of propagation microscopic investigation in the 

ecent state is of great service. C. TH. VON SIEBOLD has never 
met w^ith spermatozoa in the parts which we consider subservient to 

pecial secretions, which however they ought to contain if they 
svere really seminal vesicles as LEON DUFOUR and other writers 

uppose. The spermatozoa of Insects are like hairs, and are often 

bund in the testes united in bundles and surrounded by a transpa- 

ent covering 5 . 

We must notice, in addition, that in many species of Insects a 
!reat similarity of form has been observed between the organs of 

propagation in the two sexes. We see this resemblance in certain 



1 Bijbcl der natuur. Tab. xxx. fig. 8, m m; these are the true testes. I could almost 
uppose that LEON DUFOUE so indefatigably laborious in the anatomy of Insects and 
o rich in experience, has made the same mistake in Ptlogonus ; see the Rech. sur Ics 
lemipt. PI. xi. fig. 137 A., where I consider the spiral organs b b to be testes.

beetles, but especially in several Hemtptera, as well in the form of 
the accessory glands, as in that of the testes and ovaria, in the num- 
ber of the oviducts in the last and of the spermatic ducts in the 
former, &c. We cannot however admit that this similarity has 
the value of a general rule; the Lepidoptera, for instance, not to 
speak of other Insects, exhibit an entirely different type in the two 
sexes. 

The external sexual organs lie, as in the females, at the hind- 
most part of the abdomen 1 . The penis has a very different form 
and substance. Ordinarily it is surrounded by two horny plates, 
and enclosed in a membraneous sac in the retracted condition ; in the 
Coleoptera the penis is covered by a homy case, and supported by 
two horny threads 2 . 

Amongst the malformations of Insects hermaphroditic individuals 
occasionally occur, in which one half of the body is male, the other 
female, like the Androgynce in Africa, of whom the ancients fabled, 
and who had a female breast on the left side, and a male on the 
right 3 . This lateral bisexuality is most frequently seen in Butter- 
flies, in which it strikes the eye more readily from the form of the 
antennae or the colour of the wings 4 ; yet some instances of it are 
known in other orders also 5 . 

Before we turn from the consideration of the sexual organs of 
Insects we must shortly notice another peculiarity observed in bees 
and other Hymenoptera living in societies. Amongst these many 



1 The Chilognaiha (Julus) are an exception to this ; the parts, in both sexes, are 
here situated very far forward, at a short distance from the head. They are also 
double (two vulvce, two penes), as in the Crustacea. 

2 See the figures of STRAUS (op. cit.) in the Cockchafer, PL II. figs. 11, 22, PI. VI. 
fig. I. WAGNER compares these horny threads with the ossiculum penis, found in 
many mammals. On the sexual organs of insects, in addition to the works cited above, 
two monographs (both, however, of somewhat old date) may be consulted, viz. J. J.

individuals occur, which being incapable of propagating have been 
commonly considered to be sexless (the so-called neuters, working- 
bees, &c.) Even the external form indicates that they resemble 
rather the female than the male individuals, as the same is also 
indicated by their mode of life and their instinct directed to the care 
of the young ones. Anatomical investigation has confirmed this 
conclusion by demonstrating in the working-bees imperfect ovaries 1 . 
These individuals thus remain imperfect females, nurses, foster- 
mothers. 

Observations are not wanting with respect to the development 
of Insects in the egg, although hitherto this subject has not been 
sufficiently investigated to allow a general representation of it to be 
offered. In eggs that are just laid, nay in those which lie at the 
owest part of the oviduct and are the most mature, the germinal 
vesicle has disappeared ; in eggs situated higher up in the oviduct 
it may be seen clearly with the germinal spot 2 . On the yelk is 
'ormed, from a union of cells, a layer as germinal membrane (blasto- 
derma) which continues to grow so as to surround the entire yelk. 
The first rudiment of the embryo, the nota primitiva, lies on the 
ventral surface ; the yelk lies on the dorsal surface, and becomes 
enclosed by the constantly growing ventral plates, without the for- 
mation of a special umbilical- or yelk-sac by constriction. The 
stigmata are developed only at a late period, and become open only 
shortly before the escape from the egg 3 .

Most Insects quit the egg in a form entirely different from that 
which they afterwards possess. An impregnated female butterfly, 
for instance, deposits eggs, from which caterpillars proceed, which 
present not the slightest external resemblance with the mother. 
They are vermiform creeping animals, provided with different pairs 
of feet, which eat enormously, grow rapidly, cast their skin often, 
and at the last casting change into quite another creature, with a 
very hard and horny skin, which has no limbs, does not move from 
its place 1 , takes no food, and falls as into a death-sleep. There 
may however be generally discerned in the seemingly formless 
mass, on close observation, the external parts of the butterfly, 
which folded and rolled together are concealed beneath the horny 
shell, on whose surface they are traced out. After a longer or 
shorter time, sometimes only after many months, the perfect insect, 
the butterfly, quits its narrow cell. At first the wings are short, 
moist and unfit for flying, but soon unfold themselves, become dry, 
and then support the flapping Insect through the air, which soon 
fulfils its new destiny, the propagation of its kind, and dies 2 . 

In these changes of form (metamorphoses] of Insects the first 
form or first state is called that of the maslc or larva, and the 
Insects are then named caterpillars, maggots, &c. The second state 
is that of nymph or pupa (in day-butterflies called also chrysalis}. 
The third state is that of the perfect insect (insectum dedaratum, 
imago) . 

All Insects do not pass through this threefold state. The wing- 
less hexapod Insects,, with few exceptions, leave the egg in the 
same form which they afterwards retain ; only the rings and the 
feet become more numerous in the Myriapoda. These Insects 
LATREILLE names Insects without metamorphosis. No winged 
Insect, on the other hand, comes from the egg with wings ; but 



evolutione (De generatlone Insectorum in ovo), Francof. ad Mcen. folio, Fasciculi u. (not 
completed), relate principally to Musca vomitoria and some Lepidoptera, but do not 
give so much information as might have been expected from the diligent and patient 
investigations of the author. 

1 If the pupa be however in such a situation that the perfect insect would not be 
able to come out of it (in the branch of a tree, for instance), then it changes its place 
towards the period of the last change, by pushing on its body by contraction, a motion 
assisted in many cases by little hooks on the rings of the abdomen. 

3 Sometimes the perfect insect, shortly after its coming forth, once more changes 
its coat, as is commonly known of the Ephemera. 



INSECTS. 273 

amongst the winged there are many, which undergo no other meta- 
morphosis than that they obtain wings. Their larvce resemble the 
perfect Insect, but are quite without wings : the pupce have rudi- 
ments of wings and move themselves : in the last moulting these 
wings become developed and perfect. These Insects undergo 
accordingly an imperfect metamorphosis (demi-metamorphose LA- 
REILLE, metamorphosis incomplete^ this is the case, for instance, 
pith the grasshoppers. Most winged Insects, lastly, are subject 
a perfect metamorphosis (metamorphosis completa), as we have 
escribed it in butterflies ; the pupa takes no food, and remains in 
state of rest or slumber. The pupse of flies are entirely motion- 
ess, surrounded by a hard shell, and shew no limbs of the perfect 
nsect concealed beneath it ; this shell is formed by the dried 
ntegument of the larva. Such a pupa is named pupa coarctata. 
n other dipterous Insects and in the Lepidoptera there is a hard 
lastic membrane, surrounding the enclosed compressed external 
arts of the future perfect Insect, and so disposed that they can be 
istinguished through the covering. Such a pupa is named pupa 
btecta ; such pupae move the rings of the abdomen. In still other 
nstances the wings and feet are free, without being surrounded by 
common covering, as in the pupaa of beetles and bees 1 . 

These changes are not confined to the external parts ; in the 
nternal structure also very remarkable changes occur. The intes- 
inal canal is in most Iarva3 straight, and consists principally of a 
vide stomach. The oesophagus and the part of the intestinal canal 
>ehind the stomach are longer and narrower in the pupa and in 
lie perfect Insect, since the stomach contracts and is more definitely 
eparated from the rest of the intestine. The nervous system becomes

in the head, increases in amplitude. The sexual organs, of which 
the germs already existed in the larvse, become developed as well 
in respect of complex structure as of size. In the pupa new organs 
also come to view, of which before there was no trace, such as the 
wings, which are seen folded and rolled together internally at the 
thorax. The dorsal vessel undergoes less change than most of the 
other organs. 

There is in larvge, moreover, a peculiar fatty mass present, of 
which we have already spoken above; the secretion of this fat 
constantly increases, the nearer the larva approaches the condition 
of pupa ; in this condition the fat is consumed again, and in that 
of the perfect Insect, when it also takes food, fat is no longer 
secreted. 

The fatty secretion is thus obviously necessary to supply nutri- 
ment to the pupa, and to afford the material for the development 
of the organs of the perfect Insect. Yet the pupaa of Insects 
which undergo a complete metamorphosis, take, as stated above, 
no food, and are in connexion with the external world through 
respiration alone 1 . The condition of pupa therefore may be com- 
pared with that of hybernating animals, which are very fat in the 
autumn, during their sleep take nothing, and in the spring come 
out of their retreats in a very emaciated condition. The larva? of 
Insects eat more than is necessary for their own growth ; they are 
therefore usually inactive ; deficient motion and superfluous food 
favour, as is known, the secretion of fat 2 . The reason why inil 
perfect Insects no more fat is secreted, is found as well in the ji 
development of the sexual functions as in the greater activity of life ' 
and rapidity of motion, which are peculiar to them. 



1 On this account they lose in weight. This loss is, however, at first very small* 
and only becomes remarkable on the approach of the last change. See NEWPORT i 
TODD'S Cyclop, n. pp. 879, 880. 

2 That this fat is not necessary for the life of the larva, is shewn by the examples 
of caterpillars in which ichneumons have deposited their eggs ; the larvse from these 
consume the fat of the former, which die from the robbery of their stock of food only 
at the time they should change into pupae, or have changed. 



INSECTS. 275 

We see therefore in the perfect Insect the manly period of their 
tife : in the larva the childish period. Between the two nature has 
nterposed a deep sleep of development. The marriageable period 
a deadly for many. There are also many difficulties to be over- 
liome 1 . Some organs must for a time stand still, others (as for 
instance, the silk-secreting tubes of caterpillars) must entirely 
jlisappear. The development of the sexual organs is essential, 
[tnd for that everything must wait awhile ; these remain during the 
tarval state behind other organs ; now they repress in turn by their 
Development the activity of other organs. Finally, the perfect 
Insect comes forth, in many respects a new creature. This is the 
rue object of the phenomena, of which the metamorphosis is 

mposed, which is not so entirely unique in its kind, as might be 
first supposed. The perfect Insect lives for propagation, and 

icn it has attained that purpose of its_being, it dies to make 

om for others, and serves for food to birds and other animals, 
s also an annual plant ceases to grow as soon as its bloom is 

veloped, and dies when the seed is come to maturity 2 . 



1 Every casting of the skin is connected with more or less of danger; the moulting 
also a distressing season for birds ; but especially the last shedding, when caterpillars 

changed into pupae, is frequently fatal. Sometimes the casting is incomplete ; the 
ad of the caterpillar remains attached to the pupa. In this way may be explained 

occasional occurrence of butterflies with caterpillars' heads. See 0. F. MUELLER,

The reproductive power in Insects which undergo metamorphosis 
is wanting in their perfect state ; but if at an earlier period in 
the state of larva they have lost a foot, it grows out again at the 
next moulting, and is more or less perfectly restored. Also in the 
Myriapoda excised antennae grow again 1 . 

The nervous system of Insects has for central part a row of 
ganglia of different number, which are usually connected with one 
another by two threads that are often very intimately united. This 
row of ganglia is situated on the ventral surface beneath the intes- 
tinal canal in the mid region of the body ; the first ganglion however 
lies in front of and above the oesophagus, and there arises, by reason 
of the two threads which connect it with the second ganglion, a 
ring which surrounds the oesophagus. The greatest number of 
ganglia is found in the Myriapoda, eighteen in Lithobius (Scolop&ndm 
forficata), twenty-three in Scolopendra morsitans. In the larvae of 
butterflies thirteen are counted, but ordinarily they are less numerous 
in the hexapod Insects. Large ganglia are situated in the thorax, 
and in some there are none in the abdomen, but two nervous strings 
alone, sometimes close together, sometimes separate from each other, 
as in Nepa and Cicada. From the ganglion above the oesophagus 
(ganglion cerebrate] arise the nerves of the eyes and antennas ; this 
ganglion lies transversely on the oesophagus, formed of two oval or 
somewhat conical lateral portions with their broad part turned to 
each other ; the inferior surface is somewhat concave, the upper 
convex. The second ganglion, the first of those beneath the intestinal 
canal, is by some writers compared to the cerebellum, by others, OBI 
better grounds, with the medulla oblongata; the nerves that arise 
from it proceed to the oral parts, and perhaps correspond to th^ 
different branches of the fifth pair in vertebrate animals. Earlio 
writers, as'AcKERMANN, REIL and BICHAT, thought that the abdo- 
minal cord of Insects might be compared with the nervus sympa- j 
thicus of vertebrate animals ; CUVIER and GALL, on the contrary- 
have disowned and rejected this correspondence. It is necessary h 
this inquiry to determine in the first place what character is to b( 
considered of sufficient value to distinguish the spinal cord from thi i

ystem of the great sympathetic nerve. It is impossible to recognise 
le position on the dorsal surface as such a character ; for the reversed 
osition of the heart in the invertebrate animals might lead us rather 
expect that that of the central nervous system would be reversed 
o. The peculiarity of the sympathetic system, amongst other things, 
onsists in this, that it supplies nerves which are distributed to parts 
ot subject to the will. But since from the ganglionic cord in Insects 
le nerves of the organs of sense and the nerves of the voluntary 
mscles arise, there is no reason for comparing it to the sympathetic 
erve. The ganglia therefore of this cord are to be considered as 
n union of the ganglia of the spinal nerves of the two sides 1 . This 
iew would seem to receive more support when we reflect, that the 
)inal ganglia belong to the uppermost (the posterior) or the sensi- 
ve roots of the spinal nerves, and that in Insects two strings have 
een discovered in each connecting band between the ganglia, of 
r hich the undermost alone is connected with the ganglia, whilst 
le uppermost merely passes with its fibres over the ganglion 2 , 
t here the uppermost and not the undermost string, as in the 
)inal cord of vertebrate animals, is related to motion, is to be 
xplained by the reversed position of the nervous system. The 
milarity becomes obvious when we thus consider the matter, that 
Insects as well as in vertebrate animals the motor strings are 
Laced towards the interior, the sensorial nearest to the surface. It 
, however, perhaps more prudent not to pursue this analogy too 
ar. With these uppermost strings we must not confound the 
ystem of transverse nerves which LYONET described long ago in the 
aterpillar of the Willow-hawk under the name of brides Spinieres 3 . 
^hese are situated a little in front of each ganglion, pass transversely 
ver the straight muscles which lie lengthwise on the ventral 
urface, and are distributed by their branches to the muscles and 
specially to the air-tubes and the dorsal vessel. A longitudinal,

single nerve, lying above upon the strings of the ganglionic nervous 
system, connects each plexus with the following one. In perfect 
Insects this system is less distinctly visible, and often is completely 
combined with the rest of the nervous system l . 

There is found in addition still another nervous system in Insects, 
destined especially for the organic life, which was made known in 
part by the investigations of SWAMMERDAM and LYONET in former 
times, and described by the last under the name of nerf recurrent 2 , 
and to which in our century JOH. MUELLER has by his investiga- 
tions especially directed the attention of anatomists. It has been 
compared by him and by most modern writers to the sympathetic 
nerve of vertebrate animals, by others to the nervus vagus. This 
system of nerves consists of a single middle portion and of two lateral 
portions. The single portion arises from one or more nervous 
ganglia situated in the head, which are connected with the most 
anterior part of the first (the cerebral) ganglion of the ganglionic 
cord. From this single portion whilst situated in the head nerves 
arise for the uppermost oral organs, and a thread which runs along 
the oesophagus on the dorsal surface to the stomach, and at its 
extremity terminates in a ganglion. In Phasma ferula BRANDT 
saw numerous branches arising transversely, and running in arches 
over the oesophagus and stomach to form a fine nervous net. Per- 
haps a similar distribution may be suspected in other Insects, where 
the extreme delicacy of the nervous branches does not permit their 
determination. In most Insects the middle single portion is the 
most developed ; in Gryllotalpa and Gryllus, on the contrary, the 
lateral portions are more developed than the single and middlemost. 
The lateral portions consist ordinarily of two pair of ganglia that 
lie close together behind the cerebral ganglion, of which the 
anterior is connected with the cerebral ganglion by one or two fine 
nervous threads. From these ganglia delicate nervous branches 
arise which run to the oesophagus whilst they are also in connexion, 
by fine threads with the single middle nerve that runs over the 
oesophagus 8 .

Of the organs of sense of Insects the eyes are best known. 
We have already spoken above (p. 249) of the distinction between 
simple and compound eyes. The simple eyes have a crystalline 
lens and a vitreous humour. The cornea, on which the crystalline 
lens lies, without being separated from it by an aqueous humour, is 
formed by the common horny integument of the body, which at 
that part is raised convexly and is more transparent. The vitreous 
humour is surrounded by a black pigment of the choroid. The 
compound eyes, always two in number, present a cornea which is 
divided into many fa9ettes, ordinarily hexangular. Each of these 
divisions has the form of a small, usually biconvex lens. Behind 
them lie an equal number of transparent pyramids or conical 
bodies which are turned by their base to the cornea and by their 
apices approach each other inwards 1 . Lastly, there is a nerve at 
the apex of every cone; the optic nerve in fact divides into as 
large a number of branches as there are divisions of the cornea. 
A dark-coloured pigment, often violet or blackish brown, separates 
the nervous fibres and the transparent cones, especially at their 
pointed extremities, from each other. At the base of the cones, 
beneath the cornea, there is frequently a pigment of a different and 
more lively colour ; hence arises the metallic splendour of the eyes 
in some Insects, as in Hemerobius and Chrysops^ which however 
disappears after death. No eyelids are present in Insects, but 
between the fa9ettes of the cornea there are found in certain 
Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera, here and there, some hairs, which 
ward off substances from the eyes and defend them. Surrounding

1 WILL considers these cones, which MUELLER compares to the vitreous humour, 
for the most part as crystalline lenses, and supposes that behind them there is still a 
vitreous body with concave anterior surface to be found. In Sphinx Atropos, where 
these cones are very large, (I found them one-seventeenth Par. lin. long,) I have 
several tunes observed the separation pointed out by WILL at the posterior extremity 
of the cone. In other insects the cones are so short, that the separation, even if it be 
present, cannot well be perceived, whilst even on that account TREVIRANUS thought 
there was reason to suppose that in some insects the cones in question were absent in 
their compound eyes. Erscheinungen u. Gesetze des organ. Lebens II. i, Bremen, 1832, s. 77. 



280 CLASS VIII. 

the eyes are large air-sacs or wide air-tubes, from which fine 
branches arise, which in part run to the pigment and connect its 
granules, in part pass into blind cylindrical tubes situated between 
the nerve-threads of the vitreous cones 1 . 

DE LA HIRE, who first discovered the simple eyes of Insects, 
thought he might conclude from their presence, that the larger 
(compound) eyes were not organs of vision. That they also serve 
for vision the experiments of SWAMMERDAM, who smeared them in 
flies with black varnish, have proved. REAUMUR also did the 
same with bees. It is more difficult to determine exactly in what 
respects the office of the compound and simple eyes differs, although 
the last probably serve principally for seeing near objects. The 
bees, in which REAUMUR had smeared these eyes with a dark 
varnish, whilst their compound eyes remained uncovered, could not 
find their hives 2 ; moreover all flying Insects are invariably pro- 
vided with compound eyes. There are Insects which have simple 
eyes alone, as the Myriapoda and Parasitica (also the larvae of the 
Lepidoptera] ; few Insects are entirely without eyes, like a parasitic 
Insect of bees (Braula NiTZSCH 3 ), and a new genus of the Carabica 
Anophihalmus of SCHMIDT 4 , and different Myriapoda. In the 
diurnal butterflies and most Coleoptera, there are two compound 
eyes alone, without simple eyes ; simple eyes are also wanting in 
certain Diptera, in Forficula, Blatta and other Orthoptera, in many 
Hemiptera / where they occur in company with compound eyes, 
usually three are present, sometimes, as in Castnia, Sesia, Noctua, 
Gryllotalpa, two 5 .

For touch, in some Insects the sucker serves as the organ ; in 
others the palps which belong to the organs of the mouth, in many 
the antenna. Of taste, smell and hearing, little is known. Taste 
has its seat in the internal surface of the mouth. In some Insects 
there is a part present, which may be compared to a tongue 1 . 
Respecting smell different opinions are offered. On theoretical 
grounds, from presumed analogy with vertebrate animals in which 
the first pair of cerebral nerves always goes to the olfactory organ, 
BLAINVILLE has concluded, that the antennae, to which the first 
nerves from the cerebral ganglion proceed, must be the organs of 
smell 2 . B ASTER, REIMARUS, DUMERIL and STRAUS place the 
sense of smell in the air-slits (stigmata), which admit the external 
air to the air-tubes. TREVIRANUS however has with reason alleged 
against this opinion, that the stigmata, inasmuch as they are 
dispersed over the body, must be useless for determining the place 
from which the odorous matter proceeds ; also that in Insects, which 
have no stigmata and which respire by tracheal gills, it would be diffi- 
cult thus to account for the sense of smell. ROSENTHAL discovered 
in flesh-flies (Musca carnaria) a red-brown, folded membrane, which 
is situated in the head beneath the setting on of the antennae 3 . 
TREVIRANUS thinks that in sucking Insects, which are especially 
distinguished by their acute sense of smell, the seat of this sense 
ought to be sought for in the sucking organ itself, or in the 
oesophagus. If these animals suck in air, then they may smell 
with the same organ, by means of which, when they imbibe fluids, 



For the theory of vision with compound eyes it is necessary that the partial images 
be erect; hence JOH. MUELLER (Zur vergl. Physiol. des Gesichtsinnes) has concluded 
that insects see with their compound eyes not by refraction of the rays, but by keeping 
separate the rays of light that come from different points. Hence he denies to the 
fagettes of the cornea, which are true lenses, a refractive power ; yet that vision in 
insects with compound eyes occurs by dioptric means, has been shewn by Dr. A. 
BRANTS, and established" by means of an instrument constructed on the plan of the 
insect's eye. Tijdschr. voor natuurl. Geschied. en Physiol., XD., 1840, pp. 12 56,

they taste. An observation of HUBER respecting bees pleads for 
this opinion. Bees are very averse to oil of turpentine ; these insects 
were not, however, repelled when HUBER brought a pencil dipped 
in it to the air-slits and other parts of the body, but flew away as 
soon as he approached it to the mouth. LESSER had already 
noticed that flesh-flies, whose eyes had been smeared with oil of 
turpentine, still flew to "tainted meat, but not so when their snout 
had been smeared with it 1 . In Insects that do not suck the seat 
of smell is probably at the beginning of the ossophagus also 2 . 

Just as uncertain are we respecting the auditory organ of 
Insects, although it was known to the ancients that they have 
hearing 3 . Of this sense also several writers, and lately NEWPORT 4 , 
have sought the seat in the antennae. Yet the experiment that 
grasshoppers, when their antennae have been cut off, continue to 
hear, is even less favourable to this opinion, than is the presence of 
hearing in spiders that have, as is known, no antennae 5 . RAMDOHR 
thinks that bees hear by means of their mandibles ; TREVIRANUS 
thinks that he has discovered in Blatta orientalis G , in Libellula and 
in bees, and BLAINVILLE in Cicadce, a special auditory organ 7 . 
When we remember that for an auditory organ in its simplest 
form nothing more is required than a nerve specifically receptive of 
undulations of sound and so expanded that such undulations may 
be conducted to it by means of the hard covering of the body, it is 



1 The secretion of Slapelice, which resembles putrid flesh in smell, deceives flesh-flies 
into laying their eggs on the flowers (see ROESEL, Ins. n. Muscar. et Culic. Tab. IX.) ; 
a clear proof that the instinct of these animals is influenced more by smell than sight.

readily seen, that it is not very possible in all cases to determine 
by anatomical investigation the situation of this organ. VON 
SIEBOLD not long ago thought he had discovered in Orthoptera an 
auditory organ which is not in the head. In Locusta there are on 
the tibia of the first pair of feet two oval apertures, covered by a 
tense membrane, which DE GrEER 1 had already figured. Behind 
this there is a vesicular expansion of the air- tube of the fore-feet 
and at its anterior margin a nerve, which coming from the first 
thoracic ganglion, spreads out into a band-like swelling in which 
oval, granular bodies, together with long pediculated, remarkable 
rods, are contained. In Acridium and Truxalis there is situated in 
the first segment of the abdomen, on each side above the third pair of 
feet, a tense membrane, behind which there is a vesicle filled with 
a clear fluid: this vesicle is surrounded by an air-sac, and to it 
there runs a nerve from the third thoracic ganglion, which is also 
swollen, and in the swelling exhibits similar rod-like bodies to 
those which in Locusta occur in the nervous swelling of the fore- 
feet. 

There still remains something to be said by us respecting the 
organs of motion in Insects. The antenna of insects are attached 
to the horny covering of the body, which forms an external frame- 
work, a dermal skeleton. This ought not on that account, as has 
sometimes happened in consequence of incorrect and confused notions, 
to be. put on a par with the skeleton of higher animals ; for the bones 
or cartilages which form the framework of vertebrate animals belong 
for the most part to the neural skeleton, that is, the most essential 
and central parts that compose the column of the vertebral skeleton 
protect the spinal cord and brain and separate them from the 
rest of the body 2 . Yet there are parts present in Insects which 



1 For a more detailed description I refer to the observations of VON SIEBOLD him- 
self in EBICHSON'S Archivfur Naturgesch. 1844, s. 52 81, Taf. i. With every con- 
sideration for SIEBOLD'S great merits in the anatomy of the lower animals, I venture to 
express modestly my doubts that in insects organs of sense can occur in such an 
unusual situation. The eyes on the margin of the mantle in Pecten and Spondylus 
afford little support to this view, inasmuch as the type of the acephalous molluscs, has 
just as little claim to the possession of a head, as that of the Acalephce and Echinoder- 
mata. 

2 It is a merit of CARUS well deserving of acknowledgement, that he recognised 
and clearly defined the difference between the dermal, the visceral and the nervous 



284 CLASS vni. 

may be looked on as the rudiments of a neural skeleton. There is 
in each division of the thorax a process, which often has the form of 
the letter Y, supports the nervous cord, and by the expansion of 
its two branches, which are directed upwards, partly covers it. 
To this process AUDOUIN has given the name of Entothorax ; it is 
even found in the head and sometimes in the first abdominal ring. 
These are the same processes which TREVIRANUS had already com- 
pared to vertebrae 1 . These vertebrae, however, are not joined 
together to form a spine, but are separated from each other by 
certain spaces. The dermal skeleton of Insects consists of a pecu- 
liar substance to which ODIER gave the name of Chitine, LASSAIGNE 
that of Entomolme 2 , which occurs also in the integument of Arach- 
no'idea and Crustacea, and which is not soluble in caustic potas

burns without fusion or intumescence. It forms different layers 
which the most external is composed of irregular cells 3 . 

The arrangement of the muscles is different in the different 
orders of Insects, nay, in the same insect in its different states, if it 
undergoes complete metamorphosis. The difference between the 
muscles of the thorax and of the abdomen, which in the per- 
fect insect is so marked, is absent in the vermiform elongate* 
larva, for instance, in caterpillars. Along the dorsal and venti 
surface riband-like muscles run longitudinally ; there are different 
oblique muscles in addition. The muscles present in their bundle

is very great. LYONNET found in the larva of the Willow-hawk more than 4,000 
muscles.

white, sometimes pale red or brown-yellow, and are not surrounded 
by a fibrous membrane, so that, when detached from their inser- 
tions, they may be spread out like a pencil. 

Many insects are distinguished by special art-instincts, by their 
cunning in overpowering their prey, by the care for their eggs or 
young, by the construction of artificial habitations, &c. Their 
field of observation is greatly extended by the high development of 
heir visual organs. The faculty of indicating beforehand changes 
>f the weather by certain actions, by which some insects are dis- 
inguished, rests probably on their finer sense of the different con- 
itions of the atmosphere, since the air penetrates their whole body 
>y the tracheae. In this respect, as in so many others, they resemble 
lirds amongst vertebrate creatures, whose air-sacs and hollow bones 
ire in connexion with the respiratory organs, and in which also 
perfect correspondence between the external atmosphere and the 
nternal parts of the body is thus maintained. 

Manifold is the damage which Insects occasion to us, as well 
>y spoiling our luxuries, as by injuring or annihilating our pro- 
perty. On the other hand they procure for us many advantages, 
imongst which I need only name silk, wax and honey. But much 
nore important still is the use they supply in the great economy of 
lature, and therefore indirectly to us 1 . The injury which they 
ometimes cause us, is not only more than counterbalanced by 
hese benefits, but is for the most part only a consequence of the 
3eneficent action itself. It is these small animals that nature em- 
>loys for her great purposes, and which effect by their numbers 
rhat the largest animals working separately are unable to perform, 
lence they are less dependent on the will of man, which indeed 
lere and there may be able to destroy a species, but is unable to 
sxterminate it throughout entire districts, as it has annihilated 
Lifferent mammals in lands which they formerly inhabited. Insects 
maintain the due equilibrium in the vegetable kingdom, diminish 
)utrefaction, and lastly afford to many other animals, especially 
)irds, an abundant and ever present nutriment. 

The geographical distribution of Insects opens a wide field for in- 
quiry, which however has only been lately entered. Many families,

nay, whole orders of insects, have been collected in other parts 
of the world with more or less of inadvertency by travellers and 
collectors, or at least not with such care as to allow us to deduce 
from the species yet known any general rules. Thus, for instance, 
if we compare the number of Diptera found out of Europe with the 
European, and thus form a measure of the proportion which sub- 
sists between exotic and European species, we shall arrive at a 
conclusion which will certainly vary much from the truth. Some 
genera are proper to the warm regions of the earth alone, and in 
Europe are represented either not at all or only by a few speciea 
from the southern part of our quarter of the earth, as the Cicadce 
(Tettigonice FABR.) and the genus Phasma. On the whole our 
knowledge of some orders of insects, especially of the Hemiptera 
and Orthoptera, would be very confined, were we to limit ourselves 
to European insects. The distribution of the same or very similar 
species in countries widely distant from each other, the remarkable 
richness of the same natural group giving a special character to 
Faunai, often depends upon the same quality of the soil and a 
resemblance in the vegetation. Thus for instance the insects of the 
sandy regions of Asia near the Caspian Sea correspond to those of 
North Africa, nay even to those of the Colony at the Cape. A 
similar remark may be made in relation to the class of Mammalia. 
It is this remarkable abundance of certain forms which leads us 
at first sight, and even without having determined a single species, 
to distinguish a collection of insects from the Cape of Good Hope, 
for instance, from one from the Indian Archipelago; Mylabris, 
Pimelia (Trachynotus, Sepidium), BracJiycerus, Acrydium, Mantis, 
&c. in the first, Phasma, Pentatoma, numerous resplendently coloured 
Papiliones in the second, give to the two a totally different appear- 
ance. Some species of insects are confined within very narrow 
limits ; others, as for instance, Papilio cardui, Plusia gamma, occur 
in a considerable portion of the old world, and also in North 
America 1 . The limits of vegetation on mountains, as well as near

SYSTEMATIC 
ARRANGEMENT OF INSECTS. 



CLASS VIII. 
INSECTA. 

ARTICULATE animals, with articulate feet. Head distinct, fur- 
nished with two antennae. Heart situated in the back, similar to 
a longitudinal vessel. Organs of respiration tubular, branched, 
distributed throughout the whole body (tracheae). Sexes distinct. 

SECTION I. Apiropoda. 
With numerous feet. With thorax not separate from abdomen. 

ORDER I. Myriapoda. 

Wingless. Feet numerous (24 or more), disposed according to 
the length of the body, terminated by a single claw. Two clusters 
of simple eyes, in various number ; in some no eyes. 

Myriapods. LEACH and other modern writers consider this order 
as a class, and wish the name of Insects to be restricted to six- 
footed articulate animals, of which the body consists of three prin- 
cipal parts : head, thorax, and abdomen. Here there is no separa- 
tion between thorax and abdomen, but the whole body is parted 
into rings. The reason why we have placed these insects at the 
beginning of the class, is to be found in their resemblance to the 
ringed worms, to which they are related, not in their external form 
alone, but also in their internal structure ; for even the six-footed 
insects, which undergo complete metamorphosis, often in the larval 
state approximate to the myriapods. We willingly admit, on the 
other hand, that the myriapods accord with certain Crustaceans, and 
even form an unconstrained transition to them. But this natural 
transition is in some degree broken by other insects, which on the 



INSECTA. 289 

contrary pass through the order of the Parasites to the Arachnids. 
The Arachnids again conduct us by another road (through the 
genus Scorpio to Limulus) to the Crustaceans. Thus is the entire 
animal kingdom a net everywhere connected, and every attempt to 
arrange animals in a single ascending series must necessarily fail of 
success. 

The oral organs consist in most of two mandibles, which are 
toothed at their broad extremity, and of a four-lobed underlip whose 
two lateral lobes represent the two lower jaws (maxillce). In some 
the second pair of feet forms, by coalescence of their basal pieces, 
a sort of second underlip, which covers the oral organs and the first 
pair of feet from beneath. In certain species the jaws and the lip 
are represented by pointed organs which coalesce to form a sucker ; 
but by far the greater number are manducating insects. Myriapods 
in the first period of their life have fewer rings and only three 
pairs of feet ; as they grow new rings arise and the number of feet 
is augmented. In this respect also they resemble the ringed- worms, 
whilst in the metamorphosis of Insects the homologous parts, rings, 
segments, are not multiplied, but are developed unequally or are 
united, to form the different divisions of the body in the perfect 
Insect. The number also of simple eyes increases during the 
development of myriapods. 

These Insects live in obscure places, under the bark of trees and 
on the ground under fallen leaves, stones, &c.

These Insects (the Myriapods) live principally on vegetable food ; 
some also eat dead earth-worms and small molluscs. They diffuse, 
like many other animals of this family, an unpleasant smell which 
in some species is very powerful ; it is caused by an unctuous fluid, 
with acid reaction (SAVI), which is secreted in small sacs or vesicles, 
of which there is a pair situated in each ring. TREVIRANUS erro- 
neously supposed these vesicles to be respiratory organs, and their

apertures, which form a row on each side of the body, to be air-slits 
(stigmata). The true air-slits lie quite beneath, near the insertion 
of the feet, (SAVI op. cit. Tom. i. p. 334, BURMEISTER in OKEN'S 
I sis, 1834, s. 134 138. Taf. i.) These animals can roll themselves 
up spirally, with the head in the middle ; in which posture they 
pass the winter. In copulating they bring the anterior part of the 
body in which the sexual organs are situated (in the female in the 
fourth, in the male in the seventh ring), perpendicularly upwards ; 
the posterior part of the body rests tortuously on the ground. In 
the spring the female deposits her eggs in masses of sixty or 
seventy in a hole excavated for the purpose under the ground ; after 
three weeks or more the young make their appearance, but still 
continue to adhere for some days by a string to the shell, which has 
burst longitudinally, without motion, and surrounded by a proper 
membrane ; at that period they have no legs at all ; as soon as 
they have got three pairs of feet, they separate themselves from the 
shell ; they have now a great resemblance to the larvae of some 
Coleoptera ; soon the number of rings and feet begins to be increased 
in that part of the body which is seated in front of the penultimate 
ring.

egment, the last longest, extended backwards. Antennae usually 
nore slender towards the extremity, with numerous joints (14 40 
nd more). Organs of copulation situated at the posterior extremity 
f the body. 

These animals live on animal food, insects, &c. Their nippers 
(feet of the second pair) contain the excretory duct of a poison- 
gland, which secretes a fluid deadly to small animals, as DE GEER 1 
and LATREILLE 2 observed in flies ; the bite of the large native 
species may cause great pain in man and violent inflammation and 
swelling 3 .

15 pairs of long feet, which readily fall off as in gnats and harvest-spiders 
(Phalangia) ; it is found in France and other parts of Europe. LEON 
DUFOUR has communicated some anatomical details regarding it in Ann. 
des Sc. not. II. 1824, pp. 92 98. The compound eyes of Scutigera may 
be looked on as a special anomaly in this order ; the cornea presents 
hexangular faettes, as already figured by SAVIGNY, Descr. de VEgypte, 
Myriapodes, PI. i. 1 

There are still some other species in the warm regions of the old and 
new world, but they appear to me to be not sufficiently determined. The 
figure of PALLAS (July* araneoldes in his Spicilegia Zool. ix. Tab. iv. fig. 
1 6), ordinarily considered as synonymous with Scutigera araneoldes, is cer- 
tainly a different species. The figure of PANZER, Deutschl. Insect. Heft

pairs of stigmata. Here also in young animals the number of rings of the 
body and of the feet is smaller ; the augmentation, as the animal grows, 
appears to occur in a manner different from that in Julus, so that new 
segments and new feet appear not behind, but between those already 
formed ; and thus it is explained that the smaller dorsal shields are between 
the larger. GERVAIS, Ann. des Sc. nat., sec. Serie, Tom. vn. Zool. pp.

298 CLASS vnr. 

The phosphoric light which some species diffuse (Scol. dectrica phos- 
phorea) is to be ascribed to a fluid that passes upon the skin from open- 
ings similar to those in the Julidce (Waga). Numerous observations are 
recorded that myriapods of this division, after having caused lingering 
head-ache, have been sneezed forth by men from the nose (F. TIEDEMANN, 
Von lebenden Wurmem u. Insekten in den Geruchsorganen des Menschen, 
Mannheim, 1844, 8vo, s. n 17, to which examples many others may 
be added). To reject the observations, is certainly more easy than to 
explain the continued life of these insects in such an unusual situation.

SECTION II. Hexapoda. 
Feet six. Thorax separate from the abdomen. 

ORDER II. Thysanura. 

Hexapod, apterous, not undergoing metamorphosis, not para- 
sitic. (Mouth with mandibles and maxillae. Two groups of simple 
eyes. Setas or a bifid tail in most at the end of the body). 

Ovadvovpoi from 6v<ravos, a fringe, a tuft, and ovpd t thus named 
from some species which have jointed threads at the posterior 
extremity ; in others there is a forked tail which in a state of rest 
is bent forwards beneath the body, and on extension gives a blow to 
the ground, which causes the body to spring upwards : hence they 
may be named spring-tails. In some however the posterior part of 
the body has only two small conical hairs (Podura Jimetaria L.) or no 
appendage at all. The body is generally elongate. Some are very 
Bmall, and even the largest species are scarcely half an inch long. 
They love moisture, and live on the ground, under stones, in mould 
or old fallen leaves, under the bark of trees, in dark corners of houses, 
<fec. They undergo no metamorphosis, but change their skin often. 

The intestinal canal is straight, the stomach wide. In Lepisma 
there are two, in Smynthwrus, according to Nicolet, three vessels for 
secreting urine. The external sexual organs are placed at the 
posterior extremity of the abdomen. In the female of Lepisma a 
split tube or borer is found which serves for depositing the eggs. 



INSECTA. 297 

The nervous system in Smynthurus presents only four ganglia, of 
which the first and second lie very close together, the first above, 
the second below the oesophagus (NIC'OLET) ; in Lepisma saccharina, 
on the other hand, TREVIRANUS found twelve ganglia. The two 
eyes, which in most species are small, consist of a group of eight, 
sometimes six or seven, in Podura jvmetaria of fourteen simple 
eyes (NICOLET) ; in Lepisma saccharina twelve simple eyes are 
counted on each side. 

These" Insects, however nearly allied to the myriapods, approach 
still more nearly to the Orthoptera, and especially to the genus of the 
earwigs (Forficulce) ; see this Manual, first edition, I. 1828. pp. 204, 
205. But if, on account of this affinity, any one would place Lepisma, 
or even the whole order of Thysanuro,, amongst the Orthoptera, I 
think he would go too far. Time, the touchstone of all things, 
would reject the union. If LATREILLE had united the Thysanura 
with the Orthoptera in one order, zoologists of the present day 
would for certain have perceived long ago that these Insects were 
not in their place.

Abdomen composed of only six or fewer segments, mostly termi- 
nated by a forked tail, during rest bent forward beneath the 
abdomen, serving for springing. 

Podura L. 

Spring-tail (properly foot-tail, since the tail is used like feet for 
motion). They are small insects, which live on trees, under bark, 
under stones, on moist earth, &c. Some are met with on the surface 
of water. Since the tail, according to WAGA, is at first wanting 
in young animals (Ann. de la Soc. Entom. de France, XL quoted by 



INSECTA. 299 

ERICHSON, Jahresbericht, Arch.f. Naturgesch. 1843, 8. 270), it is pos- 
sible that sometimes young specimens of Podura may be placed 
under the genus Lipura (Anurophorus NICOLET) ; but this entire 
genus is not on that account to be rejected, for it is very usual that a 
young form in a natural family should be represented by a per- 
manent generic form. The most remarkable deviation in this family 
is that of the genus Anura GERVAIS (Achorutes NICOLET), where in 
place of jaws there is a suctorial mouth ; see NICOLET op. cit. p. 33,

Hexapod, apterous, not undergoing metamorphosis, parasitic. 
Two simple eyes, sometimes none. 

These animals, also named Epizoa (as opposed to Entozoa, our 
fifth class, see above), cannot well be otherwise defined than by the 
short account that we have given of them. The absence of a forked 
tail or of setae on the abdomen 1 , distinguishes them indeed from 
most but not from all Insects of the former order. The flea and 
some wingless species of the order Diptera are distinguished from 
these parasites by their undergoing complete metamorphosis.

Thierinsecten (insecta epizoica), in GERMAR u. ZINCKEN, Magazin der En-

tera (Hippobosca, Nycteribia &c.) are included in the same division. NITZSCH 
arranged the rest according to their oral organs, those in which they are 
suctorial, amongst the Hemiptera, those in which they are manducatory, 
amongst the Orthoptera; two orders in which the inclination to abortion 
of the wings is evident, and which undergo an incomplete metamorphosis, 
which therefore in the wingless genera can shew itself as change of skin alone.

The species of this genus occur only in man and some mammals, 
whose blood they suck. Their motion is sluggish. 

The louse of the human head has been investigated anatomically 
by our SWAMMERDAM. The intestinal canal is straight, with a large 
stomach ; there are four vessels secreting urine. Each ovary con- 
sists of five tubes. The nervous system consists, besides the cere- 
bral ganglion, of three large ganglia in the thorax, so closely placed 
behind each other as to touch ; from these ganglia the nerves of the 
feet arise, and from the last ganglion arise in addition six nerves 
which are distributed through the cavity of the abdomen.

the abdomen at each ring, by a thorax broader behind, and, as GUERIN has 
remarked, by longer antennae. Pediculus humanus corporis DE GEEK,

On Mammalia, and especially on Birds, different parasitic Insects 
are found, which were placed by LINNAEUS in the genus Pediculus, 
but which differ from it by the presence of jaws on the under 
surface of the head. DE GEER, who discovered this character, 
justly held it to be so important and essential, that he placed these 
animals in a distinct genus, to which he gave the name of JRicinus 



1 LEEUWENHOECK investigated the male louse (which is rarer and was unknown 
to SWAMMERDAM, op. cit. bl. 83) ; he found two testes on each side of the body.

changed this name, which had already been given to a genus of 
plants, to Nirmus 1 ; NITZSCH, who adopted this name for a sub- 
genus alone, named these animals Mallophaga, from juaAAo's^eece, 
since they live on hair, on scales of the epidermis and feathers, and 
not on blood. In birds there are no lice of the former family 
known all the bird-lice belong to the Mallophaga. In some are 
found small, moveable, oblong organs in front of the antennae, like 
a second pair of imperfect antennae, which NITZSCH names trabe- 
culce. The eyes are often difficult to distinguish : in some they are 
entirely wanting.

Maxillary palps with four joints, porrect. Posterior feet saltatory. 
Tarsi with five joints. 

The order of sucking Insects, which contains the genus Flea, 
agrees in the complete metamorphosis with the Diptera ; but the 
oral parts have little resemblance. The flea is perfectly distin- 
guished from the hemipterous sucking Insects not only by the 
perfect metamorphosis, but also by the oral parts, by the presence 
of palps for instance. DUGES first drew attention to four small round 
plates, which are situated on the last two segments of the thorax, 
and of which the posterior pair is the largest. These plates, which 
in colour and substance do not differ from the rest of the horny 
covering of the body, may be looked on as rudiments of wings. 
The resemblance with the metamorphosis of the Hymenoptera, 
especially in the pupa, together with the presence of these four 
rudimentary wings, may serve to explain in some degree why an 
inclination has prevailed to regard the suctoria as abortive hymen- 
opterous Insects. 

There are two simple eyes, which in Pulex vespertilionis DUGES 
are wanting. The sucker is inclosed by the flat labial palps con- 
sisting of (three ?) joints, and is composed of two flat setae serrately 
toothed on the edge and ribbed longitudinally in the middle (scalpella 
KIRBY and SPENCE, mandibles), and a thin smooth thread of the 
same length (ligula SAV.) There is no upper lip present, unless it be

represented by this ligula 1 . The maxillae are two small plates at 
whose base are attached the feelers stretching forwards, and which 
were formerly regarded as antennae ; they have four oblong joints, 
of which the second and the fourth are the longest. 

The intestinal canal of the Flea is short and straight ; its stomach 
is cylindrical, the small intestine as long as the stomach, and rectum 
short. There are four short and wide urinary tubes, which are 
implanted at the inferior orifice of the stomach. At both sides are 
two salivary vessels in form of round vesicles, whose efferent ducts 
coalesce to form a canal on each side of the oesophagus, which 
mounts tortuously to the mouth.

figures of ROESEL, Ins. II. Muscar. atque Culicum, Tab. 11 iv. (Tab. in.

Moreover these species can bear leaving their natural habitat for a time, 
and thus Pulex irritans may pass on to dogs, Pulex canis on to man. A 
particular species also occurs on fowls, Pul. gattince, SCHRANK, BOUCHE". 
All the species of this genus are small insects ; the largest hitherto known, 
Pulex gigas, has only a length of two lines, Fauna Bor. Americana of 
J. RICHARDSON, Vol. iv. 1837. The hip (coxa] of the feet is as large as J 
the thigh (femur) and very thick ; the fore-feet are placed far forwards, 
almost under the head. The abdomen is large, on the upper surface in the 
male, concave ; in copulation the female is placed on the back of the little 
male. The eggs are white, oblong, sticky. In the summer season the 
larvae come forth after a lapse of six days, having no feet, and resembling 
small, white worms. LEEUWENHOECK brought them up on dead flies, 
ROESEL on dead gnats and dried pigeon's blood. Blood that has followed

the prick of fleas and has dried into black globules, is often found dis- 
persed by the flea near the eggs that are laid in the chinks of wooden floors, 
in furniture, &c., and these globules form, according to the observations of 
DE FRANCE (Ann. des Sc. nat. i. 1824, pp. 440 443) the favourite food of 
the larvse. These larvae within eleven days are full grown, then spin them- 
selves up and change into pupae, from which after ten or eleven days the 
perfect insects appear ; in this way a new generation arises after the lapse 
of only four weeks. Comp. LEEUWENHOECK, Vierde Vervolg. van Brieven

In America, particularly in the Brazils, there is a small species of flea, 
whose proboscis is longer ; the fore- feet are not so far forward, and whilst 
the labial palps are wanting, the three threads of the sucker are not sur- 
rounded by a bivalved sheath. Consequently it has been proposed to 
make a distinct genus of this species (Sarcopsylla WESTWOOD, Dermato- 
pnUus GUERIN). This species, which lives in the open air, and is often in 
great numbers in sandy places, is Pulex penetrans L., DUMERIL, Cons. gen. 
s. les Insects. PI. 53, figs. 4, 5 ; GUERIN, Iconogr., Insect. PI. 2, fig. 9 ; 
KOLLAR, Brasilien's vorziiglich Idstige Insecten, fig. 5, s. 8, 9. The Portu- 
guese call the animal Bicho, the Brazilians Tunga; it bears also the name 
of Pique, Nigua 1 , &c. and of Chigoe amongst the English residents. Thia 
insect penetrates beneath the skin of the feet, sometimes also of the hands 
of man, and of the feet of dogs and other mammals ; the female, after she 
has penetrated beneath the skin, expands astonishingly, whence malignant 
ulcers arise, which sometimes occasion death. They infest principally newly- 
arrived Europeans : see V. HUMBOLDT'S Reise in die ^Equinoctial- Gegenden 
des neuen Continents, IV. 1823, s. 90, J. J. VON TSCHUDI (who once had six 
tumours thus caused on his right foot) Peru, Reiseskizzen, I. 1846, s. 310, 
311. A capuchin monk attempted to transplant a family of these insects 
from St Domingo to Europe, but his zeal remained unrewarded, for his foot 
in which he had harboured the colony, was obliged to be amputated on the

Metamorphosis complete. Mandibles two, forficate, narrow, sub- 
arcuate. Palps two biarticulate, very distant, inserted under the head. 
(Larvse and Pupae living parasitically in different Hymenoptera.} 

This order, first distinguished by KIEBY, cannot well be united 
with one of the others, and least of all with that of the Hemi- 
pterous Insects, as some would desire. The natural affinity is 
difficult to determine ; perhaps this order stands between the 
Orthoptera, Neuroptera, and Hymenoptera. In this uncertainty 
respecting the true place, we think we have some grounds for our 
choice, to place it after the flea, in the perfect metamorphosis as 
well as in the presence of four rudiments of wings in the genus 
Pulex. However small, moreover, the number of insects of this 
order may be, that can afford no sufficient reason either in an 
artificial or in a natural system for rejecting it. 

The winged individuals, on which the characters of the order 
are founded, are, as BTJRMEISTER had sagaciously 'surmised, and the 
complete investigations of the excellent C. TH. VON SIEBOLD have 
demonstrated, all males. In these, two large compound eyes are 
present, which consist of few faettes, separated from each other 
by a raised margin. Simple eyes are wanting; the antennae are 
composed of few joints, ordinarily split at the extremity into twc 
parts, or as if branched with lappet-like appendages. In front oi 
the wings are two small convoluted parts, named by KIRBY Elytra, 
but which do not cover the wings. It was formerly thought thai 
they were attached to the first ring of the thorax, and in that case 
they could not in any sense be looked on as imperfect wings oi 
elytra; but more accurate investigation has proved that they belong 
to the metathorax, and, therefore, may keep the name given tc 
them by KIRBY. They recal the short elytra of some Phasmatidce 
The middle piece of the thorax is prolonged into a shield over the 
abdomen. The tarsi have mostly four joints, in other species three 
or two, and no claws at the extremity. The wings (hind wings] 
are large, thin, whitish, opaque, and have some nervures wind 
radiate towards the circumference. The oral organs are somewhat 
differently described by SAVIGNY, whilst he regards as maxillce the 
parts described by KIRBY as palpi 1 . The under lip has no palpi, 
(WESTWOOD considers the palpi as belonging to the under lip, and

cal Miscellany, TIT. i8r7, p. 13$.

the mandibles as maxillae. According to this view the mandibles 
would be wanting.) These insects undergo complete metamorphosis. 
At first the larva has six feet and two threads at the abdomen, 
(somewhat the form of Lepisma}; afterwards these feet disappear, 
for the insect then lives in the abdomen of larvae of Hymenoptera. 
In these Hymenoptera, also, the parasite is changed into a pupa, 
which in the perfect Hymenoptera projects between the rings of the 
abdomen. The wingless female remains in this situation, and is 
impregnated there. It is viviparous. The six-footed larvae, which 
in the genus Xenos jump like Podurellce, were described by KLUG 
and WESTWOOD, and previously also by YON SIEBOLD, as parasites.

The general covering is, on the whole, very thin. The bod; 
consists, as in the other hexapod Insects, of three principal parts 



INSECTA. 309 

the head, the trunk, and the abdomen. On the head two compound 
eyes are usually seen, which are very large, especially in the male ; 
in the most, simple eyes or eyespots are also present, usually three, 
sometimes only two in number. The antennae are placed on the 
frons close to the eyes ; ordinarily they are, in comparison with 
those of other orders, short. Some sub-divisions of the genus 
Tipula L., make an exception to this, and the genera Macrocera 
MEIG. and Megistocera WIEDEMANN are especially distinguished by 
their long antenna?. The sucker consists of two, four, or six sharp 
threads, which in the last case represent the upper lip (labrum), 
the tongue (ligula), the two upper and the two under jaws. At 
the under jaws (maxillce) or, when these are wanting, at the base 
of the sucker, two feelers are attached, which sometimes consist of 
five, sometimes only of two joints, or of a single joint. The under 
lip forms an univalve sheath excavated above, in which the sharp 
threads or stings reside by means of which these insects wound ; 
on this part there are no feelers. The first piece of the thorax is a 
small ring, forming a neck-ring, but the middle piece (mesothorax) 
is large, and forms nearly the whole of the thorax. To this division 
of the thorax the wings are attached. These are veined, usually 
transparent as glass, and colourless, occasionally spotted ; they are 
without that little horny point at the anterior or external margin 
(punctum ccdlosum s. cubitale) which is seen on the anterior wings 
of the Hymenoptera. Behind the wings there is mostly found a 
small special appendage, a membranous scale (squama fialterum), 
which may be regarded as a part of the wing. To the metathorax 
the poisers (halteres] are attached, which consist of a thin pedicle 
and a button. These halteres are also found in species that have 
no wings. They are to be considered as rudiments of hind-wings 1 . 
The abdomen is often united to the trunk by a small part alone of 
the diameter of its base, and consists of from four to nine rings. 
In the female it generally runs to a point at the posterior ex- 
tremity ; if here fewer rings are found, it is because the last of 
them form an ovipositor or case consisting of rings that can be 
pushed in and out of each other, like a pocket telescope. The feet 
are in most long and slender, and terminate always with tarsi

jATREiLLE regarded these parts not as rudimentary hind-wings, for he thought they 
3re attached to the abdomen.

consisting of five joints. The last joint has two claws and two or 
three plane elevations or cushions (see above, p. 252). 

The digestive organs of Diptera consist of a wide bent stomach 
of moderate length, a small intestine, and an oval oblong large 
intestine. The salivary vessels vary in the different genera of this 
order. The oesophagus has a dilatation (ingluvies, crop, see above, 
p. 254) ; it is a bladder of various form, either simple, or pro- 
longed into two or more divisions, and communicating with the 
oesophagus by a long narrow tube (often with its lowest part close 
above the stomach). In larvae the tube is shorter and inserted into 
the oesophagus higher up. In by far the greater number of Diptera 
this bladder is present ', in the family of the Pupiparce it is wanting 
(comp. BAMDOHR, Abhandlung. ub. die Verdauungswerkzeuge d. Ins. 
Tab. xix. xxi, and pp. 170 185). TREVIRANUS named this organ, 
which is also found in the Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera, sucking- 
bladder ; he attributed to it a power of expanding, in consequence 
of which the air in the oesophagus is ratified, whilst, to fill this 
partial vacuum, the fluid in which the extremity of the sucker is 
planted ascends as if pumped up, (Verm. Schr. n. s. 110). The 
Herrdptera and the Pulicidce do not possess this bag ; on the other 
hand, such a crop is present in the Orthoptera, which do not suck, 
and according to LEON DUFOUR in (Edemera amongst the Coleoptera 
(Ann. des Sc. nat. m. 1824, p. 484, PL 30, fig. 7). The name of 
food-bag, which was given by RAMDOHR to this part in Diptera, is 
therefore more appropriate than that of sucking-bladder. When 
flies that have long fasted suck their full of milk, according to the 
investigations of HUNTER, milk penetrates into this bladder. By 
pressure of the abdomen, and apparently also by contraction of the 
muscular walls of the bladder itself, the food is afterwards brought 
back from this diverticulum or reservoir of nutriment to the sto- 



1 According to the anatomical investigations of SCHRCEDER VAN DER KOLK it seeme 
to be wanting in the larva of (Estrus ; but at the same point where ordinarily the 
tube from the food-bag [the name given by RAMDOHR to the sac] is inserted into the 
oesophagus, two tortuous canals are seen, which divide at their other extremity into 
two branches, which are distributed to the adipose body. Memoire sur V Anatomic 
et la Physiologis du Gastrus equi. Amsterdam, 1845, pp. 29, 30. PI. m. fig. i, b, s, s. 
BAMDOHR has figured four such appendages above and near the stomach in the larva 
of Musca vomitoria, which would seem at their other extremity to be implanted into the 
salivary vessels, and in the perfect insect to disappear. Tab. xix. fig. I. M, M, M, M. 
Do these vessels form, perhaps, a second apparatus for secreting saliva ?

mach ; (see Catalogue of the PJiysiol. Series ofComp. Anat. contained 
in the Museum of the Roy. Coll. of Burgeons, I. 1833, pp. 189, 190). 

The Diptera live long in the larva-state, but ordinarily very 
briefly as perfect insects (flies however live long in. this last state). 
Their larvas have no feet, but some of them have appendages which 
resemble them, or small hooks, which serve for motion or holding 
fast, as for instance, the larva of (Estrus. All these Insects undergo 
complete metamorphosis. Some Iarva3 cast their skin before chang- 
ing into pupge, and some in addition spin themselves up. Others, 
on the contrary, do not cast their skin, but this shrinks, hardens, 
and forms for the pupa, that resembles an egg, a kind of shell or 
case (pupa coarctata, see above, p. 273). The internal parts separate 
themselves from this shell, and the change into pupa occurs within 
this integument, which at last is deserted by the perfect insect 
when it breaks off the uppermost part in the form of a lid. 

Many of these animals are injurious to us by their puncture ; 
others suck the blood of our domestic animals j some spoil our food 
by depositing their eggs on it, especially on flesh and cheese, where 
the larva (maggots) are developed. There is, on the other hand, no 
single species of this order from which we immediately derive 
advantage. Yet so much the greater is the utility they afford 
us indirectly. Some limit the number of injurious caterpillars, 
in which they lay their eggs, and which are fed on by the pupge. 
Others free the air from pestilential exhalations by feeding on 
carrion and putrescent matters 1 . 

Family IX. Pupiparce. Haustellum of three unequal setee, 
exsertile from an aperture at the lower part of the head; at the 
sides of the retractile haustellum two laminse, inarticulate, pilose, 
porrect. Antennas very short, biarticulate, or with a single pilose 
joint. Head received behind in the emarginate thorax, or re- 
sembling a tubercle set upon the thorax. Feet short, strong, 
remote, furnished with two incurved claws. Wings divaricate, 
sometimes very short ; in some, together with the poisers, entirely 
wanting. Body depressed, covered with a hard and elastic skin. 

Pupiparous insects suck the blood of mammals and birds. The 
buccal organs pass as fine threads through a small opening (just like

a thread through the eye of a needle, WESTWOOD). These threads 
are very long in Melopliila and OrnifAomyia, shorter in 1 Ii ppobosca. 
Two oblong hairy plates project like a beak and cover the base of the 
threads when they are exserted. Are these parts to be regarded as 
maxUlce, or as palpi maxillares ? The mechanism of the sucker is 
much more conformable to that of certain Acarina than to the 
proboscis of the rest of the Diptera. 

These flies lay no eggs, but are viviparous. That which seems to 
be an egg laid by these insects, and which is sometimes as big as the 
abdomen of the mother, ought rather to be regarded as a pupa; 
from it the perfect insect (iniago) comes to view after an interval of 
time, dependent upon the temperature to which the pupa is ex- 
posed. 

The intestinal canal of these insects is very long, and surpasses 
the length of the body eight or nine times. This length is caused 
principally by the stomach, or that part of the intestinal canal 
which precedes the insertion of the vasa urinaria, and which presents 
many tortuosities. The testes are two long and very tortuous 
canals; the ovaries, two oval sacs; near the oviducts are two 
secretory glands, consisting of very numerous branches, together 
with two more simple receptacula seminis, of which the form varies 
in difierent species. The lowest part of the two ovaries opens into 
a wide sac (uterus, matrice LEON DUFOUR), in which the embryo 
resides until it comes forth as a pupa. The nervous system has, 
besides the cerebral ganglion, only a single round ganglion in the 
thorax, from the posterior margin of which the nerves of the 
abdomen arise.

Sub-genus Olfersia WIEDEM. (Feronia LEACH.) 

Family X. Athericera. Antennae with two joints or three, the 
last undivided, and presenting the form of a patella or capitulum, 
and in most supplied with a seta or spicate appendage. Proboscis 
retractile or slightly prominent, with haustellum composed mostly 
of two, sometimes of four seta ; in some the mouth is closed, with 
tubercles in place of proboscis. Pupa coarctate. 

The name Athericera (from adrjp, spica, arista), aristate or awned 
antennae, expresses the character by which this family of Diptera is 
distinguished. The larva has in this and the following family a soft, 
ringed, somewhat conical, anteriorly pointed body. Progression is 
effected by extension and contraction of the body, whose form is 
very variable. On the whole the larva does not change its skin, and 
has no feet ; in that of Helophilus and Eristalis alone are there 
seven pairs of membranous feet provided with small hooks, on the 
body beneath, which is the only example of such appendages in this 



INSECTA. 315 

order 1 . The most have no proper head, but a very moveable mouth 
well adapted for extension, and two horny hooks curved downwards. 
The skin of the larva when it changes to a pupa is not cast, but 
becomes hard, and is changed into the covering of the pupa ; the 
anterior extremity becomes thicker and rounder, and the whole 
recalls the form of an oval keg. The perfect insect, by moving its 
head, which is extended forward like a bladder, breaks this shell at 
its upper extremity, whilst a piece of it springs open like a lid. 

Few genera of this family are in the perfect state carnivorous, 
most of them living on flowers and plants.

remain firmly attached by a glutinous fluid. The young larvae come from 
the eggs, which spring open by a lid, as very long and active little worms, 
and are conveyed by the lick of the horse's tongue into his mouth and 
gullet (with respect to those eggs which lie beyond the reach of the tongue, 
we may suppose, with NUMAN, that the larvae themselves creep to other 
situations nearer the head). Subsequently the larvae live in the stomach of 
the horse, to which they have become attached in very great numbers 
(several hundreds at once). Here they remain several months, from spring 
till the beginning or middle of summer, then are detached, being expelled with 
the excrement, and change into pupae, from which, after about five weeks, 
the perfect insect comes to view. This species is found in the horse and 
ass ; besides these, and sometimes simultaneously with them, larvae also of 
other species (Gaslrus hcemorrhoidalis for instance) live in the same resort ; 
the larvae of this last species are smaller and deep red ; see NUMAN, PL n. 
fig. i.

observations ISID. GEOFFROY SAINT-HILAIRE has given an account in the Ann. de 
la Soc. Entom. n. p. 518. That larvae of (Estrus bovis and of other Diptera may 
sometimes live under the skin of man is probable from some observations ; a few years 
ago an insect was shewn me that had come out of a boil under the skin in a girl, 
it was the pupa of a dipterum, and agreed very well with that of (Estrus. A 
larva which in many respects resembled that of a Tachina, but yet differed from all 
the species of larvae of Diptera yet known, was observed by Dr SMITT ; this larva 
was pressed from a boil on the head of a girl 63 years old ; see J. J. SMITT and

SCHELLEN. Tab. i., J. C. KELLER Geschichte der germeinem Stuben-fliege, 
mit 4 Kupfertafeln. Niirnberg, 1764, 4to. The larvae live especially in 
horse-dung, and these insects are only found in the neighbourhood of human 
habitations. In a month's time one generation succeeds another, for the 
larva is full grown in fourteen days ; the fly also after fourteen days comes 
from the pupa, and the egg has only to lie a single day before the young 
maggot creeps out. Hence it is that they multiply so astonishingly, and that 
in warm summers, especially at the beginning of autumn, they may prove 
so numerous. In the open country and on the roads various species of fly 
are met with of the same size, which are usually confounded with them, as

inexhaustible riches of nature in the forms and modifications of animal 
organisation. MEIGEN counts more than three hundred species which are 
found in Europe, and of the foreign species, yet known so fragmentarily, 
still more than a hundred have been described. In some, as for instance in 
Tachina grossa, the second joint of the antennae is much larger than the 
last (see DE GEER Ins. vi. PI. I. fig. 2) ; to such species LATREILLE 
applies exclusively the name of Echinomyia, to which accordingly Tachina, 
larvarum does not belong, and which only answers to a small part of the 
Tachina; of MEIGEN.

The larvae of these flies live parasitically in other insects, many species in 
caterpillars, and, with the ichneumons, are the most serviceable in pre- 
serving a balance in the economy of nature, by restraining the excessive 
multiplication of noxious insects. Many are viviparous. Comp. C. TH.

To this genus the observations of C. TH. VON SIEBOLD refer (Observ. 
quced. entomologicce de Oxybelo uniglume atque Miltogramma conica. 
Erlangae, 1841, 4 to) ; the female of Oxybelus uniglumis, a species of 
hymenopterum, digs for each of her eggs a hole in sandy ground, and 
deposits near it some flies, her booty. In this work she is watched and 
followed by Miltogramma conica, which lurks near the entrance of the hole 
for an opportunity to slip in with her as she enters, and to fix some young 
larvse on the booty, which afterwards penetrate from it into the larva of 
Oxybelus; the reason why the Oxybelus does not drag this Miltogramma 
itself into the hole as food for the larva of her egg, is readily explained by 
this dipterum being viviparous, for then she would have drawn in the 
Trojan horse ; and hence these Tachinarice are avoided. LEPELETIER DE 
SAINT-FABGEAU has made similar observations as well on Oxybelus as on 
Cerceris; Hist. Nat. des Hymen. 1841, n. pp. 567, 568, 573.

its hiding place in August and September, to undergo its metamorphosis in 
chinks of walls. The body of the larva of this and of other species ends 
with a long tail ; hence the French name Vers a queue de rat; they live in 
cavities of stems of trees in which water is collected, in cesspools and

without occasioning much confusion. LIKNJEUS referred these flies 
to the genus Musca. By their antennae they approach the last 
family of the diptera, the Nemocera, in which there is constantly 
found a great number of joints, whilst the rest of the families have 
ordinarily three alone. At the same time the majority of writers 
consider the antennae of the Notacantha to be three-jointed in like 
manner, in which view the last joints are merely noted as rings in 
the terminal joint. But there is much that is uncertain and arbi- 
trary here. That the seta of the Athericera may be counted as a 
joint of the antenna, and that it is not separated by any sharp 
boundary from a stylus, which is itself often jointed also, will be 
readily admitted by every one who has not studied nature from 
books alone. The true place of the Notacantha in a natural system 
cannot in any case be far from Tabanus, although some only agree 
with Tabani in the metamorphosis, the genus Pachystomus for in- 
stance (LATKEILLE Genera Crust, et Ins. iv. pp. 286, 287), the properly 
so-named Xylophagi, and perhaps Co&nomyia (see WESTWOOD, Introd. 
to modern Classif. of Insects, n. p. 535). Most of the species, on the 
other hand, the species of all the genera which establish the essen- 
tial type of this family, do not cast their skin. Under the skin of 
the larva, which however does not, as occurs in Athericera, contract 
itself to a ball, the pupa is formed. Some larvae live underground, 
others in decayed wood, others in water. 

The antennae are mostly cylindrical or conical, sometimes club- 
shaped, and seldom longer than the head ; this last is a semi-round, 
of which the eyes in the male occupy almost the whole bulk; there 
are three ocelli. The body is flat ; the wings are long and cross 
one another, lying flat on the abdomen, and mostly leaving its sides 
uncovered.

649 694, Tab. 39 (under the name of Asilus). The larva is elongate, 
pointed at both extremities, with a star-shaped ring of more than twenty 
feathered filaments at the end ; it moves very slowly on the surface of the 
water. 



Family XIII. Nemocera or Tipularice. Antennae filiform or 
setaceous, with numerous joints, mostly fourteen or sixteen, never 
fewer than six. Head small, globose, with large eyes. Proboscis 
exsert, in some short, terminated by two large labia, in some pro- 
duced into a rostrum. Palps two, external, inserted at the base of 
he proboscis, filiform or setaceous. 

Thorax large, gibbous. Wings oblong. Poisers naked, with 
nconspicuous squamae. Abdomen elongate, composed mostly of 
line joints. 

Feet long, slender. Pupa incomplete (nympha). 

Thread-antennate, Gnat-like. Many, especially the smaller species, 
fly iri great troops dancing through the air. The females lay their 
eggs on the water, some on plants, or on the ground. The larvae are 
long and vermiform ; their body has twelve rings, besides the clearly 
distinct horny head. The head is provided with man ducat ing oral 
organs (mandibles and maxillce). The stigmata are in number and 
position various. These larvae constantly cast their skin before 
changing to pupae. In the pupa the parts of the insect may be 
clearly recognised. Almost always these pupae lie uncovered in the 
water or under the ground j only in some are they enclosed in a 
case or web (Sciara, Mycetophila). Many of these pupae are pro- 
vided with spines or horns, by means of which, about the time of 
the last changing, they are able to work to the surface of the earth. 

This family consists of the Linnaean genera Tipula and Culex. 
If the genus of the flies of LINJLEUS, the Athericera of the moderns, 
with short antennae and tun-shaped pupae, be considered to be the 
proper type of the two-winged insects, then the insects before us 
deviate the most from that type, and make the transition to other 
orders, to some Neuroptera (Phryganea) and Lepidoptera (Pterophorus,

approximate most nearly to the flies. 

A. Proboscis short, thick, terminated by two large labia. Setae 
of haustellum in many only two. Palps with four joints, sometimes 
five, mostly incurved or uniarticulate, straight. Tipula L. (Tipu- 
larice or Tipulidce of the moderns). 

t Antennae scarcely longer than head (or at least shorter than 
head and thorax together), mostly with eleven joints, filiform, moni- 
liform or perfoliate. Wings broad, rounded at the apex.

larva has ten pairs of air-slits ; it lives underground, and passes the winter ; 
the pupa lies in an oblong round cavity of loosely compacted earth ; after 
three or four weeks, early in the spring (in the last half of April), the per- 
fect insect makes its appearance. Comp. LYONET'S observations and 
figures, Recherches, &c., Ouvrage posthume, pp. 58 72, PI. 7. That these 
flies cause injury to the blossom of apple-trees is a common opinion, but 
entirely without proof; it is quite untrue, at least, that they lay then- eggs 
in the blossoms. The larvae, which are found in apple-blossom, are those 
of a small rostrated beetle, Anthonomus pomorum; see P. H. VAN BERCK,

Introd. ii. p. 558), but shorter. With these they prick, which the Tipulce, 
on the contrary, do not. In the south of Hungary, in the Banat, Simulia, 
maculata, Musca columbaschensis GMEL., is sometimes, from the enormous 
numbers, very troublesome, and even dangerous. Here belongs also Simulia 
pertinax KOLLAR, Brasiliens Idstige Insecten, fig. 14, which, under the 
collective name of Musquitos (Mosquitos, Moustigues), is joined to the 
gnats (Culices}. According to HUMBOLDT, in all the Spanish colonies these 
last are not called Mosquitos, but Zancudos. In North America it seems 
to be the Culices which are named Mosquitos, whilst the Simulice are dis- 
tinguished from them as 'black flies.' 

ft Antennae longer than head, mostly of the length of head and

the inconvenience. The females alone sting ; the males, known by their 
plumed anteunee, little or not at all. Another species, with black- spotted

with by me here in Leyden in winter and in the first days of spring, in 
mild weather, in dwellings. 

The gnat (Cousin, Schnacke, Milcke) is commonly known. The larvae 
live in water, and hang on the surface to breathe, with head downwards. 



346 CLASS vin. 

On the back, at the ninth ring of the abdomen, there is a tube for respira- 
tion. These larvze swim expeditiously, change their skin a few times, and 
become pupae, which also move sinuously, but do not eat, and advance in 
the water head upwards, it being kept in this position by two little tubes 
or horns that stand above the thorax and serve for respiration. On j 
the last metamorphosis the skin splits between the tubes, and the perfect 
insect creeps into view through the opening thus effected. It drifts for 
a time upon the cast-off skin as on a little boat, until the wings are strong ! 
enough, when the gnat leaves the water. These metamorphoses occur within j 
a period of three or four weeks. See SWAMMERDAM Bijb. d. Natuur. pp. [

This order is distinguished by four naked, membranous wings. 
GEOFFROY united the Neuroptera with it ; LINNAEUS, however, had 
already (in the sixth edition of the Sy sterna Naturce, 1748) distin- 
guished this order ; and to the present day it has been preserved in 
systematic arrangements. The Neuroptera have usually retiform 
wings, with numerous small cells ; in the Hymenoptera they are 
merely veined, and the under wings are commonly smaller than the 
upper. The lower jaws are mostly elongated, and form with the 
under lip a kind of proboscis by which fluids are conducted to the 
O3sophagus. The under jaws serve not for manducation, but for the 
gnawing off matters with which these insects construct their nests, 
for the bearing of burdens, &c. There are three simple eyes pre- 
sent ; the compound eyes are large, especially in the bees. The 
foot (tarsus^) has constantly five joints. The abdomen of the 
female is almost always armed at the extremity with a sting, or 
with a borer for laying eggs. Already had it been justly remarked 
by ARISTOTLE 1 , that the two-winged insects are distinguished by a 
sting in front, and the four- winged by a sting behind; the first 
wound in order to feed, the last to defend or to avenge themselves. 

In some species there are wingless individuals, of which more 
hereafter. The hind wings have at the anterior margin, nearly in 
the middle, a row of stiff hairs or hooklets Qiamuli), placed at equal 
distances, and only visible when magnified, by which they are 
fixed fast to the posterior or inner margin of the fore wings, and in 
flying lie in the same plane with these. It is especially in this 
order that in the determination of the genera use may be made of 
the veins and cells of the wings. JURINE has for this purpose 
devised a terminology, of which we must give a short account. His 
names have all a reference to the fore wing. The first vein of the up- 
per wing, that next to the anterior or outer margin, he names radius, 
the second, that lies more inwards, cubitus. These two terminate

in a thickened point (^punctum alee s. carpus) in the middle of the 
outer margin of the wing. (It is, as may be readily supposed, without 
any intention of indicating an analogy with the bones of the fore- 
arm in vertebrate animals, that these names of radius, cubitus and 
carpus have been selected.) The following veins, or nervures, which 
like the radius and cubitus arise from the base of the wing, he 
names nervi brachiales. These veins form by their branching and 
mutual communication certain cells on the wing (cellulce s. areolce). 
The outermost vein, which runs from the punctum alee to the apex 
of the wing, is named nervus radialis, because it seems to be a con- 
tinuation of the radius ; between it and the outer margin lies the 
radial cell (cellula radialis). From the cubitus there arises the 
nervus cubitalis, continued in like manner from the punctum, alee; 
the space which lies between this vein and the radial vein is named 
that of the cubital cells (cellulce cubitales). Finally, there arise from 
the brachial veins nervi recurrentes, or such as form communications 
with each other or with the cubitus, and thus form other cells, the 
humeral cells (cellulce humerales 1 }. 

These insects undergo a perfect metamorphosis. The larvae of most 
species are worms without feet ; in some species, however, the larvae 
have six horny feet ; still other larvae have membranous feet; 
the larger number of these feet (from 12 to 16) distinguishes 
them from the caterpillars or larvae of butterflies, which in other 
respects they resemble. The food of the larvae is various ; the per- 
fect insect feeds especially on the juices of plants, or swallows the 
honey of flowers. Many species also attack other insects, and thus 
appear to live on prey ; this prey, however, does not serve for their 
own nutriment, but for that of the larvae ; they are the females 
that bear it to their nest. The hymenoptera on. the whole do not 
live longer than a year, from the egg to the last change. Many, as 
the ants, wasps and bees, live socially together in large bodies, and 
form a regulated society. 

The intestinal canal of the hymenoptera begins with an oesopha- 
gus, narrow and ordinarily long, which runs straight through the 
thorax. In the abdominal cavity the oesophagus usually forms 
an oval expansion ; only in some (Crabro, Larra, Trypoxylori) does 
this expansion form a lateral crop. The muscular stomach is little

developed, and has above four membranous valves; below it is 
nan-owed in shape of a funnel, and usually is introduced into the 
next stomach by iiivagination. This stomach is cylindrical, of vari- 
ous length, and ordinarily divided by transverse folds as though 
into rings. The small intestine (beneath the insertion of numerous 
vasa urinaria) is narrower than the stomach, ordinarily not longer, 
sometimes even shorter than it ; the rectum is wider again. The 
whole intestinal canal has no very considerable length ; in many it 
is little longer than the body. In the larvae of the wasps, according 
to RAMDOHR, there is nothing but a large blind stomach present ; 
also in the pupae of the bees there is no anus; but these have an- 
terior to the stomach a narrow oesophagus, and behind the stomach 
an intestinal canal terminating blindly. 

The air-tubes present in most hymenopterous insects sacciform 
expansions. In the bees and wasps even the lateral primary stems 
in the abdomen are widened into large air-sinuses. The nervous 
system exhibits different modifications in the different families. 
The first nervous ganglion, the cephalic ganglion, is usually large, 
since the optic nerves especially are much developed. The second 
ganglion under the oesophagus lies very close to the first. In the 
thorax there are ordinarily only two ganglia, of which, the posterior 
is large ; in Athalia centifolice NEWPORT found three. The abdomen 
has from four to seven ganglia, ordinarily, however, only five or 
six. 

This order does not contain any particularly large species, although 
in the mean they are somewhat larger than the Diptera. Only a 
few species are bright coloured; the colours most frequently occur- 
ring are brown, black and yellow. The species are uncommonly 
numerous, so that in this respect the order of Hymenoptera is per- 
haps inferior to the Coleoptera alone. Most of them indicate a very 
remarkable instinct, and many construct their nests artfully. There 
is one species from which man derives a great and immediate advan- 
tage, and which he has transported with himself to different regions 
of the globe. We mean the honey-bee, of whose history we shall 
shortly treat in the sequel. 

In their metamorphosis these insects correspond with the beetles ; 
in this respect they differ entirely from most of the Neuroptera. 
Some of them by their larvae approximate to the butterflies ; and 
some butterflies (Sesia) shew a great similarity with hymenopte- 
rous insects. However, beyond doubt, the Hymenoptera have the 
greatest affinity with the two-winged insects, and we believe that,

in a natural arrangement, they can take no other place than in the 
immediate neighbourhood of these. By inserting the Lepidotera 
between the two, as is done by LATKEILLE, the natural transition is 
interrupted. 

Section I. Aculeata. Abdomen always petiolate, in females 
(and neuters) armed with a puncturing sting that conducts, in many 
at least, a poison, or containing glands that secrete and ejaculate an 
acrid humour . Antennae mostly with 12 joints (in females] or 13 
(in males). Larvae apodous. 

Sting-bearers. The wings are constantly veined. The larvae have 
a quantity of food sufficient for the entire state laid near the egg 
by the mother, or are provided with it daily by the sexless nurses. 
The latter is the case with those which live in society. 

The sting here takes the place of the ovipositor of other insects ; 
it is connected with an apparatus for the secretion of poison, which, 
in the bee, consists of two long blind tortuous tubes, which coalesce 
at an acute angle to form a single tube that expands into an oval 
bladder. From this bladder a fluid passes into the sting, just as 
from the excretory duct of the poison-gland of the viper into the 
hollow tooth. The sting consists of a pointed case grooved on the 
ventral surface, in which groove two fine spiculce drawn to a point 
are placed. At the extremity these spiculse are provided with sharp 
teeth, having their points or barbs reverted, which are less power- 
fully developed in the female (amongst bees in the queen) than in 
the sexless individuals (the working bees) ; also in the former the 
sting is longer and turned upwards, hollow on the ventral surface. 
Certain horny plates cover the base of the sting. In the males 
these parts are wanting. Comp. SWAMMERDAM ijbel d. Nat. bl.

The larvse live on the pollen and honey of flowers. Most of the 
species unite for a time, or for the duration of their life, to form a 
large community. When the society is for life, there are constantly

many sexless individuals whose business it is to construct the nest, 
and to feed the larvae uninterruptedly 1 . 

Phalanx I. Apiarice. Median division of ligula filiform or 
setaceous, of the same length as mentum, or longer than mentum, 
inflected downwards, with the maxillae, quite, from the insertion of 
the maxillary palps. Two joints of labial palps mostly conjoined, 
forming a compressed horny seta or lateral lacinia of the ligula; 
two succeeding joints very small, set laterally upon the acuminate 
apex of former. Two short paraglossge at the base of ligula. 

The proboscis of the bee has been investigated by SWAMMEKDAM 
(Bijb. d. Nat. bl. 445 451), REAUMUR (Ins. v. Qieme Memoir e, 
pp. 304 326), Gr. R. TREVIRANUS (Verm. Schriften von G. R. u. 
L. C. TREVIRANUS. 11. 1817 ; Ueber die Saugwerkzeuge der Insecten, 
s. 112 130), and other writers; and although by these researches 
we are able to learn its structure and its peculiarities even to 
minuteness, yet there still remain obscurities and conflicting opi- 
nions, especially relating to the function of the parts. The maxillse 
form an external case (demi-etuis exterieurs REAUMUR) ; the labial 
palps may be regarded as a second case, if the ligula alone be consi- 
dered to be the proper proboscis. Concerning this ligula, SWAMMER- 
DAM and TREVIRANUS adopted the opinion that it is perforated at 
the extremity by a fine aperture, and imbibes honey by its internal 
cavity. According to TREVIRANUS a canal runs from the base of 
the proboscis to the esophagus, though he could not trace the canal to 
it. In this case bees must have two mouths, which is contrary to all 
analogy. The proper mouth lies, as REAUMUR correctly observed 
(whilst SWAMMERDAM placed it in the supposed aperture of the pro- 
boscis), in the ordinary situation, behind the maxillae, and above 
the ligula ; it is covered above by a little valve attached to the 
labrum (epipharynx or epiglossa of SAVIGNY 2 ). According to REAU- 
MUR the bees lick honey with the proboscis, just as many mammals 
drink by licking with the tongue. It is probable however that honey 
is sucked up by the bee, and that the proboscis at the time, like the 
sucker of a pump, is moved up and down between the maxillae. See 
DUGES Physiologie comparee, n. pp. 317, 318, and especially the

by REAUMUR, and considered by him to be the tongue, was also named by TREVIRANUS

In one hive there are commonly 15,000 or 20,000 working bees, 600 
800 males, named drones (the ancients named them Ktj^ves, fuel), and 



1 Comp. Annal. du Mns. iv. PI. 69, fig. 5. 



INSECTA. 353 

usually one female, the queen, (the king of the ancients). The working 
bees are smaller than the queen, which is also distinguished by a larger 
abdomen. The drones are as large as the queen, or larger, (the wings 
especially are larger) ; they have no sting, and the first joint of the tarsus 
of the posterior feet is neither invested with a woolly covering, nor length- 
ened into a point ; the eyes are larger and close together. 

The working bees are, as was first discovered by SCHIRACH, nothing else 
than imperfectly developed females. If the larvae of workers in the first 
three days after leaving the egg receive a more abundant and more fluid 
nutriment, and be transferred to the larger royal cells, there proceed from 
these, according to observations, which have been often distrusted, but, as 
it seems, are not deceptive, fruitful females or queens. The instinct of the 
working bees is consequently the instinct of female animals ; they accomplish 
a part of the maternal duties and take care of the larvae, the progeny of 
their more highly preferred sister. Some of the working bees have the 
charge of collecting food and material for building ; others, apparently 
weaker, remain in the hive, care for the feeding of the larvae, and fulfil 
domestic duties. 

These insects live originally in hollow stems of trees. Our domestic bees 
build in hives, to which different forms have been given. When a swarm 
of bees first comes into a hive, they cover it internally with an adhesive, 
resinous fluid, to keep out the cold air. This substance the ancients named 
propolis ; the bees obtain it from the clammy buds and young leaves of 
willows, elms, &c. Next they build with the wax (which was formerly 
thought to be prepared from the pollen of flowers, but is a true secretion 
from the honey 1 ) perpendicular flat cakes or combs, beginning from above. 
These cakes consist of hexagonal cells, placed horizontally on each side, and 
opposed to each other by their tops, which are formed of three rhombs that 
meet in a solid angle. Each of these cells has 5^ millimeters in mean diameter, 
and, the royal cells excepted, the rest are nearly of the same size. Between 
the cakes they leave spaces, which serve as passages, and in which two bees 
can creep at the same time. Some cells contain eggs, others larvae or 
pupae, others again honey or pollen. The cell for the future queen is more 
spacious, almost cylindrical; its outer surface is rough, from impressed 
angular cavities, resembling imperfect cells. The number of these royal 



1 As early as the middle of the last century (1774), a german priest (HORNBOSTEL), 
nder the name of MELITTOPHILUS THEOSEBASTUS, published observations on the sepa- 
ation of wax, which however were rescued from oblivion by TKEVIRANUS only twenty 
ears ago. The observations of JOHN HUNTER, Phil. Trans. 1792, p. 143, are better 
nown. The secretion of wax occurs in very thin transparent little plates on the 
bdominal surface of the working bees, and is collected in the folds between the rings.

cells is from two to twenty 1 . They usually hang like stalactites at the 
margin of the honey-combs. Much wax is bestowed on these cells, which 
sometimes weigh as much as 150 common cells. 

Copulation, concerning which there has been much of fable, seems to 
occur during flight, and the lazy drones require to be excited to it by the 
queen. According to HUBER the penis remains in the queen, and the male 
dies in consequence ; the rest of the males also, as well as the male larvae, 
are put to death at the end of the summer, and cast forth from the hive. 

The larvae leave the egg after three days. After five days they prepare for 
changing. They surround themselves with a fine web, on which they are 
busied i^ days, and three days afterwards change into pupae. From the 
pupa after seven or eight days the perfect insect comes to view. This 
metamorphosis requires a shorter time in the queen, and a longer in the 
drones than we have here given for the workers (HuBEE). The working 
bees, when the perfect insects make their appearance, purify the empty 
cells, that they may be ready for the reception of new eggs. If the queen, 
as occasionally happens, should lay more than one egg in a cell, they carry 
out the supernumerary one. In the first beginning of spring (from 
February to April) no other eggs are laid by the queen than those which 
are to produce working bees ; the eggs of the drones are laid at a later 
period (April, May), and in succession ; shortly afterwards follow queen- 
bee eggs. In this way the society increases, and then sends colonies forth. 
The old queen is at the head of the colony, and leaves a daughter behind 
in the kingdom which she is leaving. This is called swarming. Bees 
swarm several times in the summer ; sometimes three or four swarms 
proceed from one hive ; but the last swarms are small and commonly perish. 
That a hive is about to swarm, may be known by a certain noise or song, 
and an unusual movement within it. The swarm leaves the hive on a 
favourable day, and gathers on the branch of a tree, on which the bees 
hang like a large bunch of grapes. 

Respecting the age which bees attain, there is difference of opinion. 
It is probable, however, as the experiments of HUBER shew, that they do 
not form an exception to other insects in this respect, and that, however a 
beehive may last five, ten, or even thirty years, there is no cause for 
believing that the bees themselves reach such an age as ARISTOTLE sup- 
posed, according to whom they may be six or seven years old. The 
queen lives longer than the working bees 2 . 

Bees have many enemies, especially amongst birds and insects ; we shall 
afterwards have occasion to mention some of them. They are also exposed 
to many diseases. 

Amongst the numerous works on bees we must limit ourselves to noting 
some. The two chief authors on Natural History amongst the ancients,

bees are : REAUMUR, Mem. pour serv. a I' Hist. nat. des Ins. V. pp. 207 728 ;

genus are numerous. They live in small societies and in inartificial dwell-

tions of bees, that hamlets or villages do to large towns. Amongst the 
females two varieties are found, of which the smaller alone lays eggs that 
produce males ; so also in Apis mellifica workers are seen, that stand half 
way between common workers and the queen, and which appear to proceed 
from larvae of workers, into whose cells some of the queen's food has 
casually fallen.

cally in the nest of other Bombi. They ought, therefore, according to the 
strict requirements of systematic division, to be arranged with the follow-

These bees are all solitary, and consist of male and female indivi 
duals alone. The females collect pollen, not only with the hind fee 
but with other haired parts of their body ; they dig under grouii' 
and place by their egg a provision of pollen and honey. Other; 
not formed for gathering pollen, lay their eggs in the nests of othe 
bees.

lopteryga (J. RICHARDSON, Fauna oreali-Americana, iv. 1837, 
p. 263). 

The wasps are mostly coloured yellow or red and black. The

rate cells, where they find food placed by the mother with the egg 
she has laid, or are fed daily by the mother or by the sterile

Vespa (Species from genus Vespa L., Vespa, Polistes LATR.) 

In wasps the upper lip (labruni) is hidden behind the head-shield 
(clypeus) and upper jaws (hintere Zunge, TREVIRANUS, Verm. Schr. 
n. Tab. xv. figs. 7, 8, 9, L'). Close under the upper-lip is found a 
valve, which SAVIGNY names epipharynx or epiglossa (vordere 
Zunge TREVIRANUS). The hypopharynx of SAVIGNY (Klappe TRE- 
VIRANUS, 1. 1. s. 134, Tab. xv. figs. 6 8, letter v.) is a valve closing 
a cavity which was discovered by BRANTS, and named gluten-cavity 
(see his work cited above, p. 452, Tijdschr. voor. Nat. Gesch. vm. bl. 
97) ; in this cavity, not unlike the buccal sacs of certain mammals, 
the wasps keep small pieces of wood for building their nests l . The 
wasp's nest consists of a kind of paper, prepared from small pieces 
of old wood and bark of trees ; they gnaw off the pieces with their 
upper jaws ; the cakes are usually horizontal ; the uppermost are 
formed first and afterwards the lower j they hang together by little 
pedicles, and the uppermost of all is fixed to the common covering; 
for most wasps form a common covering for their nests, whilst bees 
merely hide their waxen dwellings in hollow trees or under the 
ground. A wasp's nest either hangs freely in the air, or is formed 
under ground or in cavities of trees. The cells are hexangular, 
perpendicular, and generally with the opening facing downwards.

. 

In bees we saw a monarchy with a queen at the head ; here the form of 
government is a republic, the members of which are supported less by their 
own industry than by rapine. Wasps are freebooters ; they are very eager 
for the juice of fruits ; they suck the fluid that adheres to meat in 
slaughter-houses, cut pieces off, rob bees of their honey and murder them, 
as well as other insects, not for their own use, but to feed their larvae with 
them. This robber-state, however numerous its citizens may be, owes its 
origin to a single mother. She is fertilised in the autumn, and lives over 
the winter, whilst the neuters and males die, and in the spring commences 
the work alone. After a while she is assisted by sexless wasps which are 
her first-born children. In autumn males an cT females are born. At that 
time some hundreds of the last are often found in a single nest, dwelling 
in uninterrupted peace, whilst amongst bees only two or three females 
are able to be of one mind together, for a short time. The working wasps 
are smaller than the rest ; they all die from the cold of winter.

an opening in the middle. The cells are attached to different transverse

1 That this insect, the largest and .most voracious wasp of Europe, may be to some

Ants (fourmis, Ameisen, miereri}. The females have wings that 
easily fall off, or are stript off by themselves after copulation. The 
sexless individuals on the contrary are without wings, and without 
simple eyes (ocelli) also ; they are, like the working bees, imperfect 
females, as appears also from the observation of HUBER, who fre- 
quently saw males copulate with them, but the act always caused 
the death of the neuters. The males and females are found as per- 
fect insects in the nests for a short time only, for they desert them 
as soon as they have gotten their wings. The males are smaller 
than the females, and have also a smaller head and smaller upper 
jaws, but larger eyes. These animals live together socially, construct 
for themselves nests of earth, leaves, straw 1 , &c., in which other insects 
and their larvae often reside, as those of Cetonia and other Coleoptera, 
especially Brachelytra, which in these last times has given occasion 
to much inquiry among entomologists 2 . Above the place where 
they dwell the ants raise small hillocks or round heaps of earth. 
Other species live in hollow stems of trees. Along straight roads 



1 Hence there exists a species of vegetable manure and a high temperature in an 
ant's nest, which continues even after it has been deserted by its inhabitants. ROBERT,

over the ground, often a hundred feet long, which all end like rays 
at the dwelling, the ants pass to and fro ; irregular and tortuous 
passages lead to the separate habitation of the future generation. 
All the labour of building, of nursing and feeding the larvae &c. is 
discharged by the neuters. They live on fruits, insects and their 
larvae, on dead birds and small mammals. They are very fond of 
sugar, and follow the plant-lice in order to swallow the sweet sap (the 
honey-dew) that drops from their body. They lay up no provision 
for winter, as far at least as relates to our native species, but pass 
the winter in a state of torpor, taking no food at all in the severest 
cold. The working ants bear the larvae and nymphs with the great- 
est care between their jaws to the surface when the sun shines on 
their dwelling, and down again when rain falls on the earth, and 
they defend with incredible courage the commonwealth which has 
no other government but a true republic. The larvse and pupae are 
commonly taken for eggs by the uninformed, and serve for food for 
certain singing birds in cages : nightingales especially are fond of 
them. In the last days of summer (August), in warm clear weather, 
the winged males and female leave the nest in which they have 
been brought up, fly in swarms through the air, copulate, and die 
soon afterwards, being swallowed by birds, or drowned in water 
and made food for fishes. The females that are left divest them- 
selves with their feet of the wings that are now useless, and found 
a new colony ; working ants, in whose neighbourhood they chance 
to be, drag them to their nest to lay their eggs there ; when that is 
accomplished they are driven without mercy from the nest.

mique), a secretion from glands in the abdomen of the females and neuters. 
This acid is constantly fluid, colourless, of a pungent smell and sharp 
taste. FOURCROY and VAUQUELIN were of opinion that it consists of a 
mixture of acetic and malic acid; but the experiments of GEHLEN and 
others have shewn that it is a peculiar acid.

their robber by neuters which have proceeded from larvse and pupce stolen 



1 Ants are very numerous in South-America, and, by removing dead animals and 
destroying other insects, perform the same office in the economy of nature with the 
Carabici and Dermestes and other Clavicornes. The natives also eat ants. Smoked

Diggers. This family consists principally of the genus Sphex 
(sand-wasp) of LINNAEUS. The females of most of the species dig 
in the ground nests for their young, and lay in these holes near 
their eggs insects or larvae, sometimes spiders, as food for their larvse 
when they leave the egg. The larvse have no feet, resemble mag- 
gots, and spin themselves in, before changing into pupae. The per- 
fect insect is usually very lively, and sucks with avidity the honey- 
sap of flowers, on which (especially on the Umbelliferce) it is 
frequently met with. In many the lower jaws and under-lip are 
prolonged and form a rostrum ; the ligula however is not filiform, 
but commonly has a broad termination.

xansverse. Abdomen obovate, constricted or clavate at base, 
jetiolate. Antennas often thicker towards the apex.

Note. Genus Crabro (in the stricter sense) is distinguished by antennae 
geniculate, mandibles bifid at apex, a single cubital cell alone complete, 
a radial cell appendiculate (another imperfect). LEPELETIER DE ST. FAR- 
GEAU divided it into several genera, of which for the sake of brevity I omit 
the names. See his Hist. nat. d. Hyme'n. ill. pp. 99, &c., and a critical

368 CLASS vin. 

These insects are mostly coloured black with yellow spots and 
stripes. The anterior part of the head (clypeus) is beset with fine 
smooth hairs that often have a beautiful silvery or golden lustre. 
They lay their eggs in holes, which they excavate with their fore- 
feet, and place near them a provision of food (insects or spiders 
every species appears to select by preference a definite kind), which 
they drag either with their jaws or their hind feet. LEPELETIER 
DE ST. FARGEAU was of opinion that certain species whose fore-feet 
are not at all or only slightly haired, and hinder-feet without spines, 
are unfit for digging, and that they lay their eggs in the holes of 
other species, like the cuckoo in the class of birds. But later 
observations oppose this ; see WESTWOOD, Introd. to Mod. Classif. n. 
pp. 188190.

fig. 3; PANZER, Deutschl. Ins. Heft 15, Tab. 18,19 ; black ; a yellow trans- 
verse streak forward on the thorax, as also a small double spot on the 
middle of the thorax between the posterior wings and different transverse 
stripes, of which the two middlemost are interrupted in the middle ; the 
tibiae and tarsi of the same colour ; length 7 lines. The male of this, as of 
some other species, has on the tibiae of the forefeet a disciform expansion, 
which on copulation serves to clasp the female. This disk has been taken 
for a sieve (from whence the specific name is borrowed), and the property 
of sifting the pollen of plants been recognised in the insect. (ROLANDEB, 
VentensJc. AJcad. ffandlingar, Stockholm, 1751). This strange opinion owes 
its origin to the erroneous notion that the light transparent points seen on 
the disc are apertures : it was refuted by DE GEEB (Mem. s. les Ins. II. 
p. 818) and GOEZE (Natursforscker n. 1/74, s. i\ 65).

Section II. Terebrantia. Abdomen in females furnished with

ostly distinct, as though forming a second trochanter. 

Amongst these Hymenoptera, which deviate more from the usual 
type, there are many species whose larvae are provided with six 
horny feet. HARTIG first drew attention to the difference of articu- 
lation between the hip and the thigh, and named these hymenoptera, 
on that account, ditrocha, and those of the former division, on the 
other hand, monotrocha. SUNDEVALL has given a better explanation 
of this disposition, which we have followed in our statement of 
characters; Arsberattelse om nyare zoologiska Arbeten 1837 1840. 
Stockholm, 1841, pp. 324, 325. The genus Chrysis according to 
this character ought to belong to the first division.

ngle cubital cell imperfect. Antennae filiform, with thirteen joints 
both sexes. Abdomen joined to thorax by narrow, very short 
etiole, below plane or vaulted, composed of only three or of four 
onspicuous segments, dentate posteriorly in many. Integuments 
: body hard, smooth. Borer of females inclosed in concealed 
irminal segments of abdomen, receiving one another by inva- 
ination, composed of three setge, the groove of one containing the 
svo others. 

The golden-wasps. These insects were thus named on account of 
the shining metallic colours in which they glitter (the abdomen is

mostly gold-green or purple-red, sometimes blue, just as the head 
and thorax usually are), and which have caused them to be compared 
with humming-birds. 

The first joint of the antennae is elongate ; at the second joint 
they are bent geniculately. The females lay their eggs in the nests 
of other hymenoptera, whose larvae are eaten by theirs. These 
insects are protected from the sting of bees and other hymenoptera, 
their natural enemies, by their hard integument ; and besides this, 
they have the power of bending the abdomen under towards the 
thorax, and so, like the Armadillos amongst the mammalia, of 
contracting themselves into a ball. They form the transition 
between the first and second divisions, and are joined to the first, 
that of the aculeata, by HARTIG, because they are without the part 
which he considers to be a second trochanter.

Family XIX. Oxyura s. Proctotrupii LATR. ( Codrini DALMAN, 
VON ESSENBECK, with addition of other genera.) Inferior 
rings without nervures, superior either in like manner without any 
lervures, or with few and longitudinal only, destitute of cubital 
ell and often of humeral likewise. Antennas with 8 15 joints 
in most 10 12), filiform or thicker towards extremity, in males 
nostly longer, in females sometimes clavate. Borer or ovipositor 
t the extremity of abdomen, in some exsert, conical, in others re- 
ractile within the abdomen, containing three setae. 

These tail-boring ichneumons are mostly very small, some only 
1 or & line in size, or even smaller (Ichneumon atomus L.), so 
that the investigation of the oral parts is rendered very difficult, 
and the characters derived from them are often insecure. The head 
in most of them is broad, the thorax long, the abdomen oval or 
conical. In some there are no wings, or very imperfect wings 
(especially in females) j some have only four joints in the tarsus 
(Iphitrachelus HALIDAY, My mar, &c.), which has also been observed 
in the family of the Chalcidice, a remarkable anomaly in the Hymen- 
optera. The economy of the greater part is unknown ; but we may 
conclude, from those whose metamorphosis is known, that their 
larvae live parasitically in other insects, like the true Ichneumons, 
with which LINNAEUS united the few species that were known to him. 
The larvae of Platygaster live as parasites in those of the genus 
Cecidomyia (Diptera). Other species lay their eggs in the eggs of 
other insects (especially of Lepidoptera and some Hemiptera). To 
these belongs the Ichneumon ovulorum L., according to HALIDAY a 
species of Mymar, and also the genus Teleas.

376 CLASS viii. 

The Chalcidice are small Insects, mostly shining with metallic 
lustre, many species of which are able to leap, though that is not 
always the case where the ability might be inferred from the thick- 
ness of the hind-feet. Their larvse live parasitically in those of 
other insects, especially of Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera, and also 
in their eggs ; they are small maggots without feet. The pupae 
are mostly not included in a web. The number of species of this 
division is extraordinarily great ; in Great Britain alone nearly 
1200 species have been found.

This genus contains species of A inch and more, whilst the sinallost 
species are still more than 3 lines in size, so that it may be considert.il 
gigantic in this family of dwarfs. In Europe species of Zefuv.^ 
found in the southern regions alone, principally in Italy. To the extrica- 
tion of the synonomy ILLIGKR, KLUG, and lately AVi-.srwoon. have contri- 
buted : see the monograph of the last-named author, i)tomol. Mti>ia*. n.

Family XXI. Ichneumonides. Wings four, veined, the anterior 
always furnished with complete cells. Maxillary palps distinct, 
elongate. Antennae mostly setaceous or filiform, lon^. with numer- 
ous joints. Body elongate, slender. Ovipositor straight, often 
exsert, bivalved, including a borer of three seta\ 

Slip-wasps, Ichneumons. We unite in this family the Ic/nieu- 
manides and Evaniales of the systematic entomologists of recent 
times. Of many species the economy is yet unknown, yet of all 
whose mode of life has been observed the larva? are found in other 
insects, and nearly always in the lurvre of these. They are especially 
caterpillars, the larvae of Lepidoptera, in which Ichneumon- 
their eggs; the larvae of JBvania are parasites of the genus Bhttta, 
and probably live, according to an ol^ervation of MAO LEAY (related 
by WESTWOOD, Introd. to mod. Chissif. of Ins. i. p. 22) in the 
membrane of their eggs.

palps four- or five-jointed, labial with two or three joints. Thorax 
gibbous, with mesothorax very large. Abdomen compressed. 
Borer extremely slender, with three setas, concealed, rolled spirally, 
between a bivalve sheath, exsertile from the last ventral chan- 
nelled segment of abdomen. 

Gall-wasps. The females of this family pierce different parts of 
plants (leaves, leaf-stalks, buds, &c.) and lay an egg in the wound. 
The irritation thus produced causes the sap to flow in greater abun- 
dance to the wounded part, and thus different excrescences, often of 
very singular kinds, arise, which serve the larva both for food and 
habitation. The form of the excrescences is different for different 
species, and may serve for recognising and distinguishing them. 
The larvae, bent into a semicircle, lie as thick white maggots 
in the cavity of these excrescences. Some species undergo their 
metamorphosis in this situation ; others leave it before becoming 
nymphs, and change under ground. It is true that species also of 
Chalcides are found in these excrescences, which were formerly 
placed with species of Cynips in one genus, and to which GEOFFROY 
gave the name of Cynips exclusively, which occasioned much 
confusion in the nomenclature : they are ichneumons which have 
taken the place of the natural inhabitants. 

Gall-wasps, although living upon vegetable food, have neverthe- 
less a great affinity with the Ichneumonides, and this is shewn more 
distinctly by the fact that some species (Allotria WESTW.) really 
live like ichneumons in insects (Aphides), without on that account 
differing from the rest of the Cynipides by natural characters or 
organisation (WESTWOOD, Introd. to modern Classificat. of. Ins. n. 
p. 132, RATZEBURG, Die Forst-Insecten, m. p. 54). 

To the excrescences, caused by gall-wasps, belong also the gall- 
nuts or gall-apples, of which those that come from the East (from 
Aleppo) are iu most esteem. They consist, besides gallic acid, in 
great measure of tannin, and are consequently very astringent. Hence 
their use in medicine. Their property of forming a black pre- 
cipitate with salts of oxyde of iron, causes these gall-nuts to be 
employed in the preparation of writing-ink.

Family XXIII. Urocerata (Siriciclce CuETis). Abdomen sessile, 
ntinuous with thorax, covering the origin of posterior feet, cylin- 
ical or oblong. Mandibles short, thick. Wings both anterior 
d posterior with distinct cells. Tibia of first pair of feet with a 
ngle terminal spine. Borer of females in some exsert, straight, 
ith three setas, received between two horny valves, in others 
pillary, contorted at the base, contained in abdomen. Larvae 
rnished with six feet, phytophagous. 

The larvae of the chief genus of this division Sirex live in wood, 
especially fir and pine, some also in beech, poplar and birch. Of 
others the larvae are still unknown. DAHLBOM suspects that the 
larva of Oryssus lives on gall-nuts. The opinion of SPINOLA and 
LEPELETIER that the larvae live parasitically in those of wood- 
eating insects, like ichneumons, is an error, and rests on imperfect 
observation.

curved, mostly tridentate. Maxillary palps mostly sexarticulate, 
labials four-jointed or quadriarticulate. Labium cloven into three

similar to caterpillars) with mostly twenty-two or twenty feet, 
eeding on leaves. 

Leaf-wasps. The larvae mostly eat leaves like caterpillars, some 
live in gall-excrescences. These insects are often very destructive to 
trees, and the knowledge of them is therefore very important to the 
forester. Some also injure our potherbs.

OKDEH VIII. Lepidoptera. 

Hexapod insects, with four membranous wings, covered with 
ninute coloured scales. Mouth with involute spiral tongue, com- 
posed of protracted maxillae. Metamorphosis complete. 

Butterflies (Lepidoptera L., from \67rk scale, and inepov, Glossata 
FABR ) The two chief works on the anatomy of this order, that of 
LYONET and of HEROLD, have been already cited (see above, pp. 247 
and 275). To give a list approaching to completeness of the works 
which treat of the arrangement of butterflies, or illustrate their 
species by figures, would require too much space for our purpose. 
We satisfy ourselves therefore with indicating some of the prin- 
cipal sources for the knowledge of this order.

tinued, to the great injury of science. 

The scales, which cover the wings of these insects on both sides, 
appear to the naked eye as dust, but when seen through the 
microscope, are arranged in regular rows, like house-tiles 1 . These 
scales are implanted, by means of little pedicles, in short conical 
tubules, whose openings are constantly directed to that margin 
of the wing which is opposite to its base. Each scale consists 
of two (or perhaps even of three) membranes or layers. On the 
uppermost membrane lie granules of colouring matter. Elon- 
gate, parallel stripes (ribs) run from the base to the free extremity, 
which has sometimes a smooth margin, and sometimes ends in 
certain points or lappets. The underside of the scale, which lies 
next the wing, often presents a play of various colours 2 . When 
the scales are removed, the wings are whitish and semi-trans] >a- 
rent ; some butterflies have constantly such patches on the wings 
where the scales are wanting ; in some the wings are almost quite 
naked, whether because the scales are wanting from the first,

or because being fixed very loosely, they are lost on the first flight ; 
as has been observed in Sphinx fuciformis. 

Amongst the oral organs (compare above, p. 249) is seen a small 
upper-lip, often scarcely visible, which is of a triangular or conical 
form ; the mandibles are small, immoveable, and remote from each 
other. These parts exist in a rudimentary state alone. The prin- 
cipal part of the organa cibaria is the spiral tongue, formed of two 
long threads (the maxilla), which are excavated on the inside, else- 
where even, and run out to a fine extremity; when these two 
plates are laid towards each other, the two half canals form a com- 
plete canal in the axis of the tongue. At the base of the maxillae 
are placed two very short palps, consisting of one or two, at most of 
three, joints. The under-lip (labium) is triangular and flat, and 
bears two large palps, which consist of three joints ; these palps are 
covered with hairs, and mount with their points turned upwards on 
both sides of the tongue, which rolled up in a spiral lies hidden 
between them, whenever it is not in use. In some nocturnal lepi- 
doptera the tongue is very short and not adapted for sucking. 

The antennae of these insects differ in form, but always consist of 
numerous joints. The two compound eyes are large ; in many 
species there are in addition two simple eyes present. The three 
rings of the thorax are always connected immoveably with each 
other; the middle piece (mesothorax) is the largest. The wings 
are large and not folded ; in the females of some species they are 
reduced to small rudiments, or are entirely wanting. There are five 
joints in the tarsus of all the feet. The abdomen consists of six or 
seven rings, without sting or borer, as in the preceding order. 

The metamorphosis is complete. The larvae are called caterpillars 
(erucce, chenilles, JKaupen, rupsen). The body of caterpillars con- 
sists of twelve rings exclusive of the head. There are on each side 
nine air-slits; for the second, third and last ring are without them. 
The normal number of feet in caterpillars is eight pairs ; the fourth, 
fifth, tenth and eleventh ring have no feet. On the first three rings 
three horny feet are placed, which have a conical form, and consist 
of joints ; the last joint has the form of a bent nail. These 
six feet answer to those of the perfect insect. The remaining ten 
feet (some species have only eight, six, or four) are membranous 
and without joints ; they disappear in the perfect insect. On the 
underside they have a flat surface, which the insect is able to expand 
and contract, and which is surrounded by a coronet of numerous 
small hooks. The head is horny, and has six simple eyes on each side ; 



392 CLASS vin. 

moreover, there may be distinguished in it two short conical an- 
tennae, two strong mandibles, two maxillse with small palps, and an 
under-lip, which also has two small palps and terminates in a point, 
under which the efferent canal of the matter with which the cater- 
pillar prepares its web is situated. This substance is secreted as a 
fluid by two long, blind, convoluted vessels, which lie at the sides 
of the intestinal canal. Most caterpillars live on vegetable food, 
especially leaves, and many are limited to a single species of vege- 
table. Others, however, eat leather, fur, fat, wax, &c., and these 
belong especially to the family of the moths. Caterpillars usually 
change the skin four or five times before turning into pupae. 

The pupae of scaly-winged insects are quiescent, and move their 
abdomen alone when they are touched. They are oblong-ovate, and 
covered with a horny skin (jpupce, obtec'ce, see above, p. 273). The 
pupse of day-butterflies are usually not inclosed in a web, but merely 
attached by some threads at their posterior extremity, and hang 
freely with the head downward, or are fixed transversely to a branch, 
or other object, by a transverse band, as if in a hoop. The pupae 
of nocturnal butterflies either lie underground in a cavity that is 
smooth and even within, and lined with web, or they are inclosed 
in a cocoon (folliculus), which is fastened to a branch, or to a wall. 
The web is frequently silken, sometimes very closely woven, some- 
times loosely ; sometimes it consists in part of finely gnawed fibres 
of wood interwoven with the threads of web, or of other foreign 
objects intermixed with the web, crumbs of earth, morsels of leaves, 
&c. These pupae have commonly a brown or black colour. 

From the pupa of many species, especially of day-butterflies, the 
perfect insect proceeds after the lapse of a few days. Of such 
'species there are ordinarily two generations in a year. Of other 
species, however, the caterpillar or the pupa remains through the 
winter, and then the perfect insect usually appears only once in the 
yeai*, in spring or in summer. Eggs that are laid in autumn are 
mostly hatched in the following spring. 

The intestinal canal of caterpillars is straight, and consists in 
great measure of a wide cylindrical stomach. There are four very 
long vessels for secretion of urine. The perfect insect has a narrow 
oesophagus with a lateral expansion or crop (the so-called sucking 
bladder, see above, p. 310) ; the stomach has become shorter, the 
rest of the intestinal canal longer. Lepidopterous insects in the 
perfect state of butterflies either take no food at all, or suck the 



INSECT A. 393 

sap of flowers ; they lick this up by means of their maxillae, pro- 
longed into a tongue. 

This order is very numerous in species. Amongst these are many 
which attract our eye by their brilliant colours, or the beautiful 
design of the spots or streaks on the wings. It is as though nature 
had given such large wings to butterflies in order to secure a wider 
space for her pencil. 

Family XXV. Nocturna. Antennae setaceous or pectinate. 
Wings horizontal for the most part or deflected, guarded by a 
retinaculum, with few exceptions. Posterior tibiae with double 
internal spine. 

Nocturnal Lepidoptera, Moths. The species of this and of the 
following family are distinguished by the so-called retinaculum, 
which they mostly possess. This part consists of a horny highly- 
elastic hair, or of a little bundle of two or more hairs, which arise 
on the anterior margin of the hind-wings close to their insertion. 
A little flat ring on the under-surface of the fore-wing allows it a 
passage, and thus both wings are connected, and similarly pressed 
forwards and backwards, and in flight form only a single surface \ 
Almost all these moths fly by night alone, or after sunset. The 
females of some species are wingless, or have only minute rudiments 
of wings (as Phalcena brumata, Bombyx antiqua, &c.) The form of 
the larva is various, and they have from 10 to 16 feet. Most of 
them make themselves a web, in which they change to pupae. 

This family in the system of LINN jsus forms only a single genus, 
which he names Pkalcena.

with only ten feet, the rest with twelve, always with anal feet. 
Pupa inclosed in a thin follicle. 

The genus Phalcena or Geometra is principally characterised by 
the caterpillars ; since these have no feet in the middle of the body 
they move in creeping, as leeches do, by flexion and extension of the 
body. Hence these caterpillars are named surveyors or span-cater- 
pillars (erucce geometricce, chenilles arpenteuses, Spanner.)

JSuropa, of which the entire sixth part (Leipz. 1827, 1828) is set apart for

has made a subdivision according to the antennae ; where they 
are pectinate he gives to the specific name the termination -aria (as pini- 
aria), when they are setaceous that of -ata (as grossulariata 1 ). The cha- 
racteristic of pectinate antennae, however, besides that it is proper to the 
male alone, occasionally separates naturally allied species. As little can 
the separation of these species, which have wingless females, of which 
LATREILLE forms his sub-genus Hybernia, be commended.

of Lepidoptera, so that there may be observed, principally among the

Equites), not in habit alone, bat also in colour. Perhaps a parallel series

Lepidoptera. Other exotic Phalienai approach more nearly to the genus 
Urania, but yet amongst European species Phalcena sambucaria presents

some degree in miniature the two-tailed caterpillars (Bombyx vinula, 
furcula;) whence some writers have placed them with the ombt/ces 
(Verzeichniss der Schmetter. der Wiener gegend, p. 64, HUBNER, LATREILLE) ; 
LINN^US and FABRICIUS, giving their attention exclusively to the per- 
fect insect, placed the species known to them amongst the Phalcence 
geometrce, with which indeed they have a greater affinity. The point in 
which the body of the caterpillar terminates behind forms a supernumerary 
segment (a thirteenth ring), which represents the two hind-feet that are 
wanting.

third terminal joint more slender than the preceding or small.

Butterflies (Rhopalocera BOISDUV.) These insects have usually 
clubbed antennae, which is the case with all our domestic species ; 
when at rest they erect their wings, so that the upper surface of the 
wing is turned inwards. The genus Papilio of LINNAEUS corresponds 
to this family of later writers.

DUVAL, Nouv. Ann. du Museum, n. 1833, PI. 14, figs, i, 2, has a spiny 
caterpillar with the first four membranous feet short, so that it moves like 
a geometric caterpillar. It does not spin itself up when about to change 
to a pupa, but affixes itself by means of a thread stretched transversely over 
the body, like the caterpillars of the genus Pieris, &c. This species, placed

by DALMAN under Cydimon, forms the type of a separate sub-genus Urania 
or Thaliura DUNCAN. 

The affinity with Castnia, especially with Coronis and Agarista, cannot 
be mistaken ; and some writers, amongst whom is WESTWOOD, place Urania 
in the former family. In those species, however, which I have examined, 
I can discover no retinaculum.

OEDER IX. Neuroptera. 

Hexapod insects, with four wings membranous, mostly trans- 
parent, reticulate, naked, most frequently equal. Mouth not suc- 
torial, but in most formed for manducation, with mandibles in some 
obsolete. Females never aculeate, very rarely furnished with borer 
or exsert oviduct. Metamorphosis in most incomplete, in others 
complete. Larvse hexapod. 

Tendon-winged. Neuroptera L., from vevpov, tendon, and TTTepdv, 
Odonata and most Synistata of FABRICIUS, Neuroptera and Tricho- 
ptera KIRBY. On this order in general I am acquainted with no 
other special work than that of P. RAMBUR, Histoire nat. des In- 
sectes Neuropteres ; Ouvrage accompagne de planches. Paris, 1842, 
8vo, making a part of the Suites a BUFFON by RORET. Other 
works on particular families we shall indicate below. 

The Neuroptera are insects with four naked, mostly transparent, 
wings, of which the veinures form a fine net-work. Usually the 
under- wings are as large as the upper ; in many species of Ephemera, 
however, they are very small, and in some entirely absent. The 
females have no sting ; rarely only there exists a borer or an instru- 
ment for depositing eggs. Hereby they are distinguished from the 
Hymenoptera, as well as by the lower jaws with the under lip not 
being produced into a sucker. The number of joints in the tarsus 
is different in the different genera. 

Many insects of this order are, in the state of pupa and perfect 
insect, carnivorous and truly predaceous. The larvae for the most part 
live in water (Phryganea, Semblis, jEphemera, Libellula). Some larvae 
spin themselves up when they change into pupse. In the larva of the 
lion-ant the vessel which secretes the web, an oval sac, is situated in 
the abdomen ; it ends in a tube capable of extrusion ; by means of it 
the larva spins together granules of sand to form a round ball, within 
which it changes into a pupa. In the larvae of the genus of the 



INSECTA. 413 

Case-nymphs (Phryganece) there are, as in caterpillars, two long 
vessels, which secrete the silken material. In their straight intesti- 
nal canal, also, and in the small number of their vasa urinaria, 
these larvae resemble caterpillars 1 ; and on the whole the genus 
Phryganea, although still really belonging to this order, forms a 
very natural transition to the Lepidoptera, which does not rest 
merely on general external resemblance or analogy. 

In this order many species are met with in which the instinct 
is surprising, and their economy extremely interesting; we name 
merely the lion-ant with its crafty device to overpower its prey, 
and the celebrated mines and buildings of the white ants, or ter- 
mites, &c. 

A. Neuroptera with metamorphosis complete. 

Tarsi in all quinquearticulate. 

Family XXVIII. Phryganidce (Trichoptera KIRBY). Wings 
deflected, posterior often broader than anterior, folded longitudi- 
nally, the anterior with numerous branched nervures, covered with 
hairs, coloured. Mandibles obsolete or very small, remote, not 
convergent. Maxillary palps long, with three to five joints, 
labial palps short, three-jointed. Prothorax short. (Antennas with 
numerous joints, long, mostly setaceous. Ocelli three.)

Phryganides. Avec pi. color, i vol. 4-to. Geneve, 1834. 

Case-nymphs, Caddis-flies. The upper jaws are here very small 
and little developed, as in the last order (SAVIGNY, Mem. s. I. ani. s. 
vert. I. p. 29, PL i. fig. 1). The larvae live in water, in cases open 
at both ends, composed of small pieces of wood, of small fresh- water 
shells (in which frequently the inhabitants are still resident), of 
sand, of duck-weed, of fragments of leaves that have fallen into the 
water, &c. They fasten these substances together by means of their 
web ; the inner surface of the case, which is very smooth, is also 



1 KAMDOHR found only four, which agrees with the number in caterpillars, but 
this requires to be confirmed by further investigation, since LEON DUFOUR, in the 
jpecies examined by him, always met with six. However, the Ephemerince and 
Libettulince, i. e. by far the greatest number of the Neuroptera, have very numerous 
'30 40) short vasa urinaria, like the Orthoptera; those which undergo a perfect 
netamorphosis only six or eight ; see LEON DUFOUR, Mem. presentes, Tom. vn., and 
LOEW in GERMAR'S Zeitschrift fur die Entomologie IV. (1813), s. 423, &c. (Bemer- 
wmgen uber die anatomischen Verhaltnisse der Neuropteren.) 



414 CLASS VIII. 

lined with the web. Most species drag the case with them, but 
others fasten it to stones and creep in and out. These cases protect 
the larvse from the persecution of fishes, which are very fond of 
them ; in England, where fishing with the line is brought to a much 
greater state of perfection than perhaps anywhere else, these larvre 
are much used for bait. The larvse feed on vegetable as well as 
animal substances. Most of them have white threads at the abdo- 
men, external respiratory organs, gills (see above pp. 262, 263). 

The larvse, when about to change into pupae, fix these cases firmly 
and close the openings with crossing threads, that thus form a latticed 
cover. The pupae, at first immoveable, quit this dwelling when 
about to change into perfect insects j it swells and bursts in order 
to allow the perfect insect an exit. This last is generally brown- 
coloured, and resembles a nocturnal butterfly. On an evening, at 
country-houses, it is frequently allured by the light into apartments, 
and flies round the lamp or candle until, its wings half-consumed, it 
falls down with violence on the table. The eggs are joined together to 
form a gelatinous mass, and are deposited by the female on leaves of 
branches which hang over the water, so that the young larvae on 
creeping out may easily fall into their natural abode, if the leaf by 
falling previously has not already reached the water. 

See on the economy of these Insects especially REAUMUR, Mem. Tom. H. 
pp. 497 581, and, on the arrangement, besides RAMBUB and WESTWOOD, 
also especially BUBMEISTEE, Handb. der Entomol. n. 2, 1839, pp. 882 935.

I have indicated is Neur. ruficottis of RAMBUR. Another genus of 
RAMBUR, Dilar, unknown to me, with pectinate antennae in males, appears 
to be related, but has a greater affinity, as I conjecture from the descrip- 
tion and figure, with the Hemerobii.

These broad-winged insects are provided with eyes shining with gold 
during life ; the delicately latticed wings, as transparent as fine gauze, 
present the colours of the rainbow. The larva lives on plants, and 
resembles that of the lion-ant ; it feeds on leaf-lice, and is covered with a 
mealy substance, to which the cast-off skins of the leaf-lice adhere, so that 
the true form of the insect is often quite irrecognisable ; the small, oval, 
white eggs are seated on long thin pedicles upon twigs and leaves.

The larva of this insect is known under the name of Lion-ant, and is 
far-farned for its cunning. It has six feet, very large upper jaws, a flat 
head, and a large oval abdomen. It moves slowly, and almost always 
backwards. Unable to pursue its prey rapidly, it seeks to compass it by 
subtlety. To that end the lion-ant digs funnel-shaped holes in the sand, by 
moving constantly backwards in still smaller circles, and casting out the 
sand with its head. During this work it is almost entirely concealed 
beneath the sand, the head and jaws alone projecting above it. Should the 
lion-ant in the meanwhile encounter a little pebble, too large for his jaws, 
he creeps out of the sand, endeavours to push his abdomen under the 
pebble, attempts in this way to creep with his load to the edge of the 
funnel, and repeats the operation until he finally succeeds, although the 
pebble repeatedly falls off behind him. When his work is completed, the 
lion-ant lurks under the sand in the middle of the conical cavity, and 
pushes his two upper jaws out of the sand like open shears, continually 
during the night ; by day he does this more seldom, and only when an 
insect falls into the hole. Any small insect that ventures incautiously to 
the edge of this pitfall, and stumbles in the dry sand, is effectually griped 
by the pincers ; should it try to escape, the lion-ant greets it with a shower 
of sand, and causes it again to tumble down. If the lion-ant has clutched 
the insect, he shakes and tosses it about, sucks it dry, and casts the 
empty body as lumber out of his hole. The lion-ant may be most aptly 
compared to a spider, and like as this weaves nets proportioned to its size, 
so he makes his funnels larger the larger he grows. When full-grown, he 
spins grains of sand together for an abode, almost perfectly spherical, in 
which he changes to a pupa, and from which after four weeks he makes 
his appearance as the perfect insect which flies by night. Comp. on the 
economy of this insect REAUMUR, Ins. vi. pp. 336 386, PL 32 34,

Libella? or water-nymphs. These insects in all the states of their 
life are very greedy and rapacious. The antennae of the perfect 
insect have commonly from five to seven joints. The feet are short, 
especially the middle pair, and bent forwards. Copulation occurs 
in a remarkable manner, the extremity of the abdomen in the fe- 
male being bent round like a ring towards the breast of the male. 
Here are found, on the ventral surface of the second ring of the 
abdomen, the external organs of generation, a penis placed between 
two horny booklets, which in jEshna and Libellula is perforated by 



INSECTA. 421 

an efferent canal arising from two small vesicles filled with a yellow 
fluid : these glands are wanting in Agrion 1 . The larvae and nymphs 
live in the water, and resemble the perfect insects. The under-lip 
has the form of a mask or hood, and covers the mouth j anteriorly it 
terminates in two hooks 2 . It is bent round and set upon a long 
flat pedicle, which the animal can move forward rapidly, whereon 
the bending disappears ; thus the insect supplies itself with a move- 
able forceps for seizing its prey unawares at a distance with the 
hooks at the extremity of the under-lip. (See figures in SWAMMER-

ends either with five horny plates, which can be moved from and to 
each other, or with three fin-like laminae ; it was in these laminae 
(in the genus Agrion) that CARUS first discovered the circulation of 
the blood ; see above, p. 259. 

With LINNAEUS this family forms only a single genus, Libellula.

ae penis is not connected with the tesles, of which the va*a defer entia terminate at the 
linth ring of the abdomen, RATIIKE was of opinion that the union observed in the 
jibelhdince is not a true copulation, but only precedes it. VON SIEBOLD, however, 
ietected spermatozoa in the male at the base of the abdomen, so that the male, by 
ending round the abdomen towards the thorax previous to copulation, seems to deposit 
ae sperma there. WIEG MANN'S A rchiv f. Naturgesch. 1838, p. 375.

two or three filaments. 

Ephemera L. (Characters of the family.) 

May-Flies, bank-bait. The larvae and nymphs live at the bottom 
of the water between stones, or in the ooze ; some dig horizontal 
passages, in which they move very rapidly. In these two states 
they live two or three years before changing into perfect insects j 
they proceed from very small eggs. The larva has always three 
threads at the abdomen, of which the middle one in many species 
disappears after the metamorphosis \ it is distinguished especially 
from the perfect insect by longer antennae, by stronger upper jaws, 
and by external respiratory organs at the first six rings of the abdo- 
men ; the air-tubes appear as free threads or little plumes, or are 
united by membrane to form a foliated lamina. Some larvae have 
on each side of every ring two such plates. The change from 
nymph to perfect insect occurs in JEphemera Swammerdamii (Palin- 
genia longicauda BURM.) so suddenly that there is almost at the 
same moment a creeping and a flying creature. In other species, as 
in those observed by RCESEL, the change takes place more slowly. 
They moult once again in their perfect condition ; and if we be 
walking by the banks of the water over which they are flying we 
often see this moulting performed on our clothes. 

In the middle of summer the May-Fly takes wing towards even- 
ing. The time of flight differs in different species. That which 
SWAMMERDAM described shews itself nearly three days in succession, 
about St John's day, in the month of May, and often in such quan- 
tities that it is as difficult to count these little creatures as falling 
snow-flakes. A great many^fall into the water a prey to fishes, and 
at that time, especially at Dordrecht, the roach is noted as being 
peculiarly fat and good. Hence the name bank-bait, oeveraas (in 
some parts of France la manne). According to the relation of 
SCOPOLI they are collected by the country-people in Carniola to 
manure the land (Entomol. Carniol. p. 264). 



424 CLASS VIIL 

SWAMMERDAM, in the species described by him, did not observe 
the copulation, and supposes that the eggs, as in fishes, are first laid, 
and afterwards fertilised by the male. REAUMUR doubted this, 
because the eggs sink in water. But R(ESEL, DE GEER, and later 
writers, have actually observed the copulation in other species; 
and thus it is improbable that the species of SWAMMERDAM forms 
an exception on this point. 

Ephemerce 011 the whole live as perfect insects but a short time, 
some not even a single day. Once however I kept some specimens 
of Ephemera diptera (Cloe diptera PJCTET) for some days alive under 
a glass, two for more than a week.

These insects were first distinguished by GEOFFROY as a separate 
genus, whilst LINNAEUS placed them amongst the P/iryganece, to 
which they have some relation by the broad posterior wings. Till 
within a few years it was generally supposed by writers that the 
Perlce have a complete metamorphosis, in consequence of an imper- 
fect observation of NOLLET, recorded by REAUMUR. PICTET however 
has announced the metamorphosis to be incomplete ; the larvae do 
not live in cases, but mostly in running water, by preference under 
stones. Some have at the thorax external respiratory organs ; others 
breathe through closed stigmata, which have the same situation as 
the future apertures of the perfect insect, and take in the air by 
endosmose. They have constantly two threads at the hinder part of 
the body, which sometimes disappear in the perfect insect, but in 
many species persist at that period. The males of some species have 
short wings, merely rudimentary.

the body pale yellow, with yellow eyes. This insect is commonly found on 
wood, upon walls, in old papers, &c. ; it has superficially a resemblance to 
a louse, but runs very rapidly. The Latin specific name is derived from 
the idea that the ticking in old furniture and door-posts, which superstition 
often receives as a bad omen, is caused by this insect; on the contrary, 
they are small beetles which cause the tapping sound. An anatomical 
investigation of this little animal was published by NITZSCH in GERMAR u. 
ZINCKEN, Magazin der Entomol. iv. 1821, s. 276 282, Tab. n.

These insects bear, in different tongues, the name of white ants ; 
they live, like these, in society together, and in warm countries 
cause incredible damage. Of the wood- work which they destroy, they 
leave the surface untouched, so that every thing externally preserves 
its form, but falls to pieces on the slightest touch. The hardest 
wood cannot resist these animals; glass, metal, and stones alone do 
they leave uninjured. Some species live underground, others in 
trees ; some erect pyramidal mounds above the surface, which in 
Guinea and other regions of the African coast are raised to the 
height of twelve feet, and are so stable that they may be mounted

with safety (Termesfatalis L., Termes bellicosus SMEATHM.) Below, 
in the middle of the building, is the residence of the female (mon- 
strous is the distension of the abdomen in a pregnant female which 
lays perhaps 80,000 eggs) ; round about this residence are cells for 
the eggs, magazines for food, &c., all orderly arranged. The upper- 
most part of the hill-like dwelling is massive, to give more firm- 
ness, and to guard the family from the influence of weather and the 
attacks of foes. It is generally supposed that the labour of building 
in these societies is performed by the larvse, but perhaps it is by the 
sexless individuals who have not got their wings ; they have no 
eyes. There are still other wingless individuals, also without eyes, 
but with larger jaws ; these are commonly called soldiers, because 
they ward off attacks and always stand at guard. When these 
insects attain their perfect state they leave the dwelling at night- 
time ; on the day following their dried wings fall off, and they are 
in great part eaten up by birds, lizards, and even by the negroes. 
A fertilised female is borne off by the larvse to a dwelling, and there 
she lays her eggs. According to SMEATHMAN the workers would 
seem to carry off a male and a female with them, in order to shut 
them up and feed them for copulation.

Hemipteres, Paris, 1833, 4to av. 19 pi. 

The Ilemiptera are commonly provided with four wings, of which 
the anterior are leathery at the base, thick, and not transparent, and 
at the point membranous (lwmclytra\ or are membranous like the 
posterior wings, but often stronger and larger than these. The mouth 
consists of a sucker composed of threads and a case. The case is tubu- 
lar, grooved above, and consists of joints; it corresponds to the un- 
der-lip of other insects. The small upper-lip becoming thinner for- 
wards, covers the base of the sucker. In the groove formed above by 
the turnover margins of the under-lip, there lie in appearance three 
setse, but the middle one is double (the two under jaws (maxillae) 
and the two lateral threads are the upper jaws 1 ). The maxillary 
palps are entirely absent ; so also are the labial palps, or these last 
are only in quite a rudimentary state 2 . Thus the beak of the 
hymenopteTa is constructed for sucking. The fine threads (setcs 
haustelli, mandibulce, maxilla?) make a wound in the parts of plants 
or animals, on the fluid or blood of which they feed, the fluid 
ascending between the threads to the oesophagus above. 

The antennae have commonly only four or five joints, extremely 
seldom more than eleven. Many species have two or three simple 
eyes. There are never more, but often fewer, than three joints in 



1 G. R. TREVIRANUS was the first who distinguished the four threads in Cimex 
rufipes (Annalen der Wetterauischen Gesellschaft, I Bd. i Heft, 1809. s. 171). 
SAVIGNY has shewn the analogy with the oral organs of other insects, and figured

the feet. The metamorphosis is incomplete, with only few excep- 
tions (the males of the gall-insects and the genus Aleurodes). 

With respect to the natural affinity of this order, and its place in 
a natural arrangement of insects, we remark that it agrees with 
the Ortkoptera in the imperfect metamorphosis, but differs from this 
order very greatly in the oral organs and in the internal structure. 
The last family of the preceding order, the Perlce and Termites, on 
the contrary, have a position very close to the Orthoptera ; and it is 
only with reluctance that we interrupt this natural transition by 
interposing the Hemiptera between them. But the Hemiptera, 
whatever position be allotted them, must always stand by them- 
selves as a very deviating group of insects. The absence of 
maxillary palps might perhaps be considered to be their most 
important character, which elsewhere in the class of insects are 
more constant in their presence than the labial palps 1 . Some 
species of Hemiptera homoptera (the genus Plata) have some 
resemblance to the Lepidoptera, which however, is rather an 
external similarity (analogy) than a true relationship (affinity), 

The intestinal canal of the hemiptera is long, (see above, p. 253). 
In many CicadaricB (Cicada, Ledra, Cercopis, &c.) there is an 
arrangement, which was formerly considered to be a return of the 
intestine into the stomach, but which has been since described by 
DOYERE in a more satisfactory manner; the tortuous intestinal 
canal does turn back to the stomach and attaches itself to it, to 
leave it subsequently at another point ; but it does not open into 
the stomach, but merely runs along its wall, between the coats of 
the organ 2 . In some Geocorisce (Scutellera, Pentatoma, and some 
species of Coreus) the inferior part of the stomach before the 
insertion of the vasa urinaria is tortuous, and consists of four 
(in Coreus marginatus of two) grooves or semi-canals, which have 
transverse white rings or folds of even width, between which there 
is a very thin and transparent membrane 3 . Salivary glands are 
ordinarily much developed; mostly more than one pair are pre- 
sent; they are situated on each side of the intestinal canal, arid 
open into the oesophagus ; in the leaf-lice they appear to be wanting. 



1 RATZEBURG indeed describes in Cicada a three-jointed maxillary palp (Mediz. 
\Zool. ii. Tab. 27, figs. 16, 17); but this part, according to BURMEISTEB, is a jointed 
horny process, to which muscles are attached.

430 CLASS VT1T. 

The disagreeable smell, peculiar to most heteroptera, seems for their 
protection, and is caused by a fluid that escapes through two aper- 
tures, one on each side, beneath the thorax at the insertion of tlio 
third pair of feet. According to LEON DUFOUR this fluid is 
secreted by a small round or oval pouch, commonly of a yellow 
colour, which is situated in the abdomen; it is rarely double. 

Many genera of hemiptera are met with only in warm countries, 
and the European species form but a small part of the numerous 
order. 

Section I. Homoptera. Elytra deflected, in most coriaceous or 
membranous, similar to posterior wings, but larger and stronger. 
Rostrum rising from the inferior part of head, inflected beneath the 
breast between the bases of the feet. Thorax gibbous, with first 
segment shorter. 

In this division, which as well as the second, WESTWOOD ranks as 
a distinct order, the upper wings are constantly of a similar substance, 
and not half-horny or leathery and half- membranous. The antennae 
consist in many of more than six joints. The beak lies on the 
breast (rostrum pectorale). All live on juice of plants. The females 
often have an instrument for laying their eggs, composed of three 
filaments, toothed plates or saws, enclosed between two valves. 

A. Metamorphosis (in males at least) complete. 

Family XXXV. Coccina ( Gallinsecta REAUM.) Males winged, 
with mostly two wings, without rostrum. Wings without cells, 
with only two longitudinal nervures. Antennae mostly with nine 
to eleven joints. 

Females (one genus excepted) apterous, attaching themselves to 
trees or herbs at the time of parturition, sometimes assuming the 
form of a gall, their own vesicular dead bodies covering their eggs. 

Gall-insects. These insects were thus named by REAUMUR from a 
superficial resemblance of the pregnant female to a gall-nut. (See 
above, p. 384). The joints of the tarsus have not been given by 
us amongst the characters on account of the minuteness of the 
objects and the prevalent uncertainty; for whilst many writers (ex. 
yr. LATREILLE and WESTWOOD) ascribe one joint alone to this family, 
and distinguish it principally by this, others assign three (BoucHE 



INSECTA. 431 

even four) joints. The character also of a single claw alone at the 
end of the tarsus is not constant.

Forst. Ins. in. s. 188. 

Coccus L. (in part). Wings two and often poisers in males; 
males apterous. Abdomen in males with two terminal setse. 
ostrum of females short, with long exsertile setse concealed and 
iflected in abdomen. 

Sub-genera : Lecanium ILLIG., Coccus BUKM., Pseudococcus WEST. 

To this division, and indeed especially to Lecanium, what we advanced 
in the characters of the family respecting the females has reference ; to this 
genus alone the name Gallinsecta is appropriate. To it belongs Coccus 
Ilicis L., Lecanium Ilicis ILLIG., REAUMUR, op. cit. PL v. ; in the south of 
Europe and in the East, the Jcermes of the Arabians, from which word the 
appellation Icarmozijn, crimson, for a red colour, is derived. This insect, 
formerly used in medicine, now only as a dye, has however lost much of 
its value since the introduction of the Cochenille from America (Mexico), 
which first came to Europe in 1526. The last-named species, Coccus cacti 
L., lives upon the Nopal, Cactus coccinellifer (Opuntia coccinellifera 
DECAND.), cultivated with that view. See figures of the insect in DUMERIL, 
Consid. gen. s. 1. Ins. PI. 39, fig. 2, BRANDT u. RATZEB. Medizin. Zool. n.

II. fig. i. It is computed that 70,000 dried insects go to a pound of 
cochenille, and formerly 880,000 pounds of this dye were imported. Comp.

On the introduction of this insect into our East Indian possessions, a 
report may be found in the Alg. Konst-en Letterbode, 1829. No. 30. 

Another species, Coccus ficus FABR. (probably a species of Lecanium), 
lives in Bengal on different species of Ficus and other plants ; the young 
insects are seated close together on the young shoots, and round about the 
place where they have sucked themselves fast, there drops a thick fluid, 
which hardens into a tough transparent substance, the gum-resin, gummi- 
lacca. The dye of this substance is used under the name of lac (lac- dye, 
lac-lake), as a very beautiful substitute for cochenille, and the shell-lac 
deprived of the colouring matter as a component of lac-varnish, of sealing- 
wax, and as an isolating body in electrical apparatus. See on this insect

Aleurodes (Aleyrodes) LATR. 

Note. Genus Aleurodes (Aleyrodes) LATR., seems rightly to be 
referred to this family by BURMEISTER. Metamorphosis complete, 
as in males of Cocci; pupa quiescent, folliculate. Also anterior 
wings sufficiently similar to wings of Cocci. But the number of 
wings (four), which are not wanting in females, the rostrum too, with 
which, as it seems, the males also are furnished, seem to indicate 
the separation of this genus from the Coccina, and accordingly 
LAT.REILLE joined it with the Aphidii, and lately, HARTIG with the 
Psyllte ; WESTWOOD, however, to avoid a difficulty, preferred creating 
a small family from the single genus.

INSECTA. 433 

Leaf-lice, Plant-lice, Pucerons. These animals live together on 
different plants and trees, and mostly in very large numbers. They 
do not leap, but run commonly very slowly. From the hind part 
of the body there often drops a transparent honey-sweet fluid, of 
which ants are very fond and on that account are often found 
in the neighbourhood of the leaf-lice. These suck the sap of the 
plants, and some species, by puncturing the leaves or leaf-stalks, 
produce excrescences or swellings occasionally hollow, which are 
filled with a great number of these animals and often with a 
considerable quantity of the sweet sap. The sticky fluid on leaves, 
known by the name of honey-dew, is caused by leaf-lice. Most 
species are covered with a powdery substance or with white threads, 
(a peculiar secretion of their body). 

To counteract the excessive multiplication of leaf-lice, in the great 
economy of nature, a number of enemies are on the watch, not 
merely ichneumons (see above, p. 378), but insects especially which 
feed on them and devour large quantities, the pupae of some diptera, 
of hemerobii (p. 418), of beetles (Coccinellce), &c. 

LEEUWENHOECK had already noticed that plant-lice are viviparous, 
that they also lay eggs was first discovered by LYONET j but the 
succession of generations, the descendants of mothers and grand- 
mothers which are viviparous and fruitful without copulation, was 
first discovered by BONNET ; see above, pp. 263, 264.

Some species live on the roots of plants. They have no wings ; BOUCHE, 
however (according to RATZEBURG, Forst-Ins. in. s. 216), discovered two 
species of Rhizol>ius that were winged. These species may be collected

of the head 2" 6'" long). According to MEEIAN this insect at night-time 
diffuses a clear light ; which, however, is denied by later writers. As 
little, according to BOWRING (Ann. of not. Hist. XIV. p. 427), is the Chinese 
species, Fulgora candelaria L., phosphorescent. In Europe, especially in

Cicadce. These insects are found in warm countries alone, hi 
woody districts especially. The females, when about to lay their 
eggs, perforate the branches by means of two serrated horny plates, 
enclosed between two jointed waives and supported at the back by a 
grooved horny part, formed of two pieces which have coalesced 1 . 
The larvae on leaving the egg quit the place, and betake themselves 
underground, where they suck the roots. Here too they change 
into nymphs. 

The ancients made much of these animals and considered them to 
be favourites of the Muses, whilst living on dew at the top of high 
trees they heralded the approach of summer with their clear song, 
and resembling the gods, as is sung in an Anacreontic ode, had like 
them no blood in their bodies 2 . 

The musical organ of the male is situated on each side at the base 
of the abdomen and covered by a valve. A horny, triangular 
partition corresponding to the entothorax, separates the two lateral 
cavities. Each of these, when vie wed from the ventral aspect, presents 
in front a white folded membrane, but down at the bottom, a stretched, 
thin and transparent lamina, which REAUMUR calls le miroir, the 
looking-glass (Mem. v. PI. 17, figs. 1, 2, 3, 6 m). If the part be 
opened from the dorsal surface, another folded membrane is seen, the

When these muscles contract powerfully on each side and then 
suddenly relax, a vibratory motion arises, producing a sound which 
is swelled by an air-vesicle, a vesicular trachea, that lies near the 
drum. The sound is the so-called song of the cicadce, which is 
peculiar to the males, whence XENARCHUS extolled the fortune of 
these animals, whose wives are dumb. 

The so-named manna, not to be confounded with that which 
served the Israelites for food in the Arabian desert, is an exudation 
from ash-trees in consequence of the puncture of the Cicada orni.

Section II. Heteroptera. Elytra coriaceous at the base, mem- 
branous at the apex. Rostrum frontal, rising from the anterior part 
)f the head. 

The insects of this division are the only ones properly to which 
the name of hemiptera is applicable. Some amongst them suck the 
blood of other animals; others live, like those of the preceding 
division, on the juices of plants. The anterior segment of the 
thorax is much larger than the other two. The antennae have 
never more than five and ordinarily only four joints.

the more accurate distinction of the species formerly known, far 
more than 100 genera have already been formed by modern writers.

Emesodema was afterwards formed. This species, magnified, is several times figured hi

winged; but here, in all probability, we have another species before us, 
which SCHILLING described as Cimex domesticus in 1833 (OKEN'S/SW, 1834,

Note. The generic name Cimex I judged formerly, with LATREILLE, to 
be attributable to Cimex lectularius, according to the rule of LINNAEUS (Phil. 
Botan. 246), which says that if a received genus is to be sub-divided, the 
previously common name ought to remain with the species most commonly 
known (species vulgatissima) ; but it seems advisable to give a received 
name to numerous species rather than to a few. Besides, a new name 
would be required, for that given by OLIVIER, Pentatoma, is inapplicable to 
several species of this genus, and the distinction taken from the number of 
joints of the antennae is artificial, often severing affinities. For many 
genera of modern writers, not here recorded, see BURMEISTER, 1. 1. p. 347,

ORDER XI. Orthoptera. 

Hexapod insects, with four wings, the upper coriaceous elytra, 
the lower membranous and folded in their length radiately like a 
fan. Mouth constructed for manducation, with strong mandibles ; 
maxillae furnished with galea cylindrical, vesicular (internal palp). 
Metamorphosis incomplete. 

Straight-winged. OLIVIER first separated these insects under the 
name of Orthoptera from the order of the Hemiptera of LINN^EUS^ 
and characterised this new order by the mode in which the under- 
wings are folded and by the presence of a galea on the lower jaws. 
In the oral parts they differ altogether from the liertiiptera. But if 
we stand, not upon the name of the order, but upon the distinction 



1 Encycl. in6th., Hist. not. Tom. iv. Insect. Paris, 1789. Introduction, p. 16. 



INSECTA. 449 

of it, then we cannot in any way look upon OLIVIER as its founder, 
because DE GEER had already collected into a distinct division, to 
which he gave the name of Dermaptera, the self-same insects which 
are now arranged in the order of the Orthoptera. Mem. pour servir 
a rffist. des Ins. 1773, p. 309. He characterised these insects 
by their leathery shield-covers and the parts subservient to mas- 
tication 1 . 

Many orthopterous insects have two or three simple eyes. The 
antennae always consist of a great number of joints. The left upper- 
jaw is on the whole more toothed than the right. The under-lip is 
divided into four lobes, of which the two exterior correspond with 
the galese of the under-jaws. 

The first thoracic segment is generally large. Ordinarily there are 
ftnir wings; sometimes, as in the mole-cricket and many species of 
Phasma, the anterior wings are very small, the posterior large ; in 
Phi/Ilium, on the contrary, the hind-wings are entirely absent, and 
there are only fore- wings or shield-covers; the instance of Perla- 
morpha, CURTIS is entirely peculiar, where shield-covers are wanting 
and hind- wings alone are present. The joints of the tarsus are in 
most fleshy or spongy beneath; the number of these joints is in 
every species the same for all the feet, and varies from three to five. 

All the Orthoptera hitherto known are terrestrial, during the 
different states of metamorphosis. Some are carnivorous or 
omnivorous, but the greater number feed on plants. But some 
species often appear in great numbers and are very ravening, and 
may cause terrible devastation ; this is especially the case with the 
locusts, a dreaded plague of the East. 

The intestinal canal is on the whole short, and even in those 
species in which it has the greatest relative length, it is to the 
length of the body only as 1 or 2 : 1. The oesophagus has an 
expansion which may be considered as a crop or fore-stomach ; this, 
in the mole-cricket, is situated quite laterally. The muscular 
stomach is small, orbicular, armed internally with horny teeth, 
which are arranged in six rows. Round the inferior orifice of this 
stomach are blind appendages of variable number; the genus Acheta, 
for instance, has only two such, Gryllus FABR. (Acrydiwm LATR.) 
six, Mantis and Blatta eight. Of the numerous vasa urinaria in 
this order we have spoken above (p. 256), as also of the presence of

clustered salivary glands'. There are ten pairs of stigmata, two on 
the thorax and eight 011 the abdomen; the air-tubes are largely 
developed. In the species of the genus Acridium, which take such 
long nights, there are vesicular expansions in the abdomen in which 
the spiral thread is wanting. The nervous system consists of eight 
to ten ganglia, and the nervous cord in the abdomen is often some- 
what bent or tortuous.

Section I. Saltatoria. Posterior feet saltatory, with large 
thick thighs and tibise, armed on the posterior margin with a 
double row of spines. (The tibiae are received in a furrow on the 
inferior surface of thighs, when folded forwards previous to leaping), 

The insects of this division present, more strongly than those o: 
the following, the typus of the order. 

The production of a sound or song is peculiar to species only o 
this division 2 . As in the Cicadce, so here it is only the males thai 
produce the sound. 

Amongst the numerous writers on this subject, it may suffice to refer tx 
the work of GOREAU, illustrated by many figures ; Essai sur la stridulatiw 
des Insectes, Annal. de la Soc. Entomol. de France, vi. 1837, pp. 3275. 



1 LEON DUFOUR informs us, incorrectly, that the salivary glands in the Orthopter> 
were unnoticed until by himself, Mem. pres. VII. p. 297. But long previously, G. B 
TREVIRANUS had observed these parts in Blatta (Biologie, iv. s. 323, 324), whos 
opinion, that they occur in this genus of the order alone, was abundantly refuted b 
J. F. MECKEL, who found them also in Mantis, Phasma, Acheta and Locusta, thoug 
less developed than in Blatta. System der vergleich. Anat. iv. s. 118, 119. 

2 Hence to the Orthoptera of this first division the name of Stridulantia might t 
given, to the second that of Muta.

Family XL. Gryllides nob. (Genus Gryllus L.) The charac- 
rs of the section are also those of the single family. 

A. Elytra and wings deflected. 

Phalanx I. Acridii. Antennae filiform or subclavate, some- 
imes depressed, acuminate towards the apex, mostly short or 
loderate (not longer than half the body), with six to twenty-five 
oints. Ocelli three. Tarsi with three joints. 

LEACH and WESTWOOD (see Introduction to modern Classif. of Ins. 
WESTW. I. p. 438) name the insects of this group Locustidce, because 
LINN^US had named the sub-division of his genus Gryllus, to which the 
common grasshopper belongs, and which in great measure composes the 
present division, Locusta. It would certainly have been better if GEOFFKOY 
had not given the name Locusta to the sabred-grasshopper with long 
filiform antennae (Gryllus viridissimus L., &c.). But now that this generic 
name has been adopted by FABKICIUS, LATKEILLE and all subsequent 
writers, we think that a change of signification would rather increase than 
diminish the confusion of which the above-named English authors complain. 

The three simple eyes are placed in a triangle ; the two lateral, 
between the compound eyes and the antennae, in the middle and 
sometimes quite on that surface of the head which is directed down- 
wards. 

Of the three joints of the tarsus the first is long and appears to 
consist of three joints that have coalesced ; so that to these insects 
perhaps might very properly be ascribed five joints in the tarsus, as 
by LATKEILLE in his Families natur. du Regne animal, and by our- 
selves in imitation of him in the first edition of this Handbook. 

The sound produced by these insects is caused by a rapid friction 
of the thighs of the hind-feet against the shield-covers ; here the feet 
act like the bow of a violin. The first abdominal segment is mostly 
furnished with a drum on each side, distinguished externally by 
a circular or lunated membranous cover. Behind this membrane is 
situated a small vesicle filled with fluid, and behind this again a large 
air-tube vesicle. Whilst some recognise in this an instrument for 
sound, like that of the Cicadce, J. MULLER and V. SIEBOLD consider 
it to be an auditory apparatus; see above pp. 282, 283. 

The borer for laying eggs does not project much, it consists 
of four curved pieces. The eggs are mostly enveloped in a common 
covering, adhering to each other by a tenacious frothy matter, and 
in many species hidden beneath the earth.

Note. LATREILLE conjoined in sub-genus Podisma, species of which the 
elytra and wings are short and unfit for flight. As FABRICIUS had previously 
written the genus Acrydium incorrectly, so also LATREILLE called it Acry- 
dium, whom many imitated. It is, however, 'AKpidiov ; and I would wil- 
lingly have rejected the diminutive form, and have given the name Acris 
to the genus, since large, and even the largest species are contained in it. 
It appeared, however, more advisable to give the name of Gryllus to this 
the largest portion of the old Linnsean genus of the same name.

the year 1748 such a sort of all-destroying locusts spread itself over the 
west of Europe, to the Netherlands, nay even to England. That they are 
able to cross the sea, is placed beyond doubt by many accounts, according 
to which people on ship-board, many miles from land, observed the swarms. 
Some districts of the South of France are frequently damaged for several 
years in succession by different species of grasshoppers, for the collection 
of which large sums of money are sometimes bestowed. In 1824 at 
Saintes- Maries, in the neighbourhood of Marseilles, 1518 corn-sacks were 
filled with grasshoppers, and at Aries 165 sacks; the expense amounted to 
5542 fr. ; in 1833, in the first-mentioned place, 3808 kilogrammes of eggs 
of these creatures were collected; the number of eggs that make up a 
kilogramme may be computed at about 80,000. (See Ann. de la Soc. 
Entom. de France, n. 1833, PP- 4^6 489; these observations refer, how- 
ever, to other species than Gryllus migratorius.) Different large species are 
eaten by people of the East, as, for instance, Gryllus cristatus L., RCESEL,

nations (Hist. not. Lib. vi. c. 30 in fine, Lib.xi. c. 29 in fine), not to speak

1 CHARPENTIER records a winged species from Chili. Elytra were not present; 
wings very small ; but what seems most to distinguish this species is the absence of a 
pulvillus or plantula on the tarsus. Hence it might form a distinct genus Astroma

Phasma LICHTENST., FABR. (Spectrum STOLL). 

These insects are in great part confined to tropical countries; 
many also are found in New Holland. They live on vegetable food. 
Some wingless species have the form of dried twigs, and others, 
which are flat, with membranous and vein shield-covers, have a great 
resemblance to leaves (the genus Phyllium.) Of some species the 
males are much smaller than the females; the former have often 
three simple eyes, which in the last are absent. In this division 
the largest species of insects are found.

scarcely longer than mesothorax, sub-triangular, posteriorly nar- 
rower. Antennae of males setaceous, pilose ; of females very short, 
filiform. Elytra short and wings long in males ; in females elytra

extended from the Sechelles over Java and Timor to New-Guinea. Some 
allied species are from the same regions and from China ; none are known 
from the new world. 

Phalanx II. Mantides. Anterior feet raptorial, with coxas long 
and femora compressed, receiving the tibia beneath. Prothorax not 
shorter than mesothorax, mostly exceeding the mesothorax in 
length. Ocelli three. Antennae mostly setaceous, moderate. La- 
brum entire, orbicular. Labium quadrifid, with Iacinia3 equal. 
Elytra and wings in all. 

The anterior feet are situated close to the head, and are much 
stronger than the rest, usually very thin; they have large com- 
pressed thighs which are armed beneath with teeth or spines, and 
have a channel in which the tibiae can be lodged like a clasp-knife. 
With these fore-feet bent together and with head on high, these 
insects often sit long in an immoveable position. Hence the eastern 
people say that they are at prayers, and moreover, like true Ma- 
hometans, with the face and hands turned towards Mecca. With 
this pious deportment however, and the superstitious reverence 
which is in consequence conferred on these insects by different 
nations, their cruel worldliness is at variance ; they live on other 
insects, and also mutually devour one another. See BLUMENBACH, 
Abbild. natur-historisclwr Gegenstdnde, No. 88.

The Kdkerlacs are nocturnal. They are great devourers, and gnaw 
even leather, shoes, &c. The name Blatta (from pXairreiv, to injure) occurs 
already amongst the ancients ; yet probably it signified other insects. The 
female lays her eggs heaped into separate, little masses distributed in 
cells; see GCEZE, NaturforscJier, xvn. s. 183 189, Tab. IV. figs. 1619.

subcrustaceous, not reticulate, abbreviate, truncated, incumbent on 
back, placed in contact by a straight suture. Posterior wings mem- 
branous, partly folded in longitudinal rays, partly transversely, 
covered by elytra. 

The insects of this family make the transition from the Orthoptera 
to the Coleoptera. LINN^US counted them with these last, as did 
also STRAUS amongst more modern writers. LEACH and KIRBY 
form a distinct order of them, under the name of Dermaptera 
(Transact, of the Linn. Soc., Vol. XL 1815, p. 87); this name, 



INSECTA. 463 

which BURMEISTER changed into Dematoptera, had been previously 
(see above, p. 449) given by DE GEER to the order of the Orthoptera. 
LEON DUFOUR, who subsequently proposed the same separation, 
named these insects, in imitation of DUMERIL, Labidura; WEST- 
WOOD Eupleocoptera (Zool. Journal, 1831, Modern Classification, I. 
1839, p. 308). At all events these insects have greater agreement 
with the Orthoptera than with the Coleoptera ; they differ from the 
last by their incomplete metamorphosis and by many particularities 
of internal structure. The great size of the under-wings in com- 
parison with the elytra is very common in the Orthoptera (to refer 
to Phasma alone), and the reflexion of the point of the wing also is 
not wanting in some other Orthoptera, as, ex. gr. Anaplecta, the last 
of the sub-genera of Blatta recorded above. 

Forficula L. Body depressed, narrow, elongate, with prothorax 
quadrate. Antennse filiform, a little longer than half the body, with 
joints very distinct, mostly more than twelve (ten to forty). Ocelli 
|none. Labrum entire, orbicular ; mandibles denticulate ; labium 
>ifid, with palps short. Abdomen with last segment forcipate, with 
forceps horny, moveable, in males arcuate, or more open.

Earwigs, perce-oreilles, Ohr-ivurmer. It is said that they creep into the 
ears, and hence this name; this they do not more than other insects, which 
by chance may get into the ears of persons asleep. They live in moist 
places, and eat almost everything ; they are especially fond of fruits and 
honey. The females sit on their eggs, and guard them; the young also 
creep under their mother, like chickens under the hen, and she often sits 
quietly for hours together over them. DE GEER, Mem. s. I. Ins. III. 
p. 548. 

Note. Some are. without hind- wings but provided with elytra, or are 
entirely apterous. According to difference of form and number of joints 
in antennae, LEACH, LATREILLE, and especially SERVILLE, have formed 
several sub-genera, of which it may here suffice to cite the names ; Apachya,

Appendix to the Order Orthoptera. 

Thrips L. Body linear, depressed. Head produced inferiorly 
like a rostrum ; labrum elongato-conical ; mandibles setiform ; max- 
illae triangular, acuminate, with short palp, of two joints or three, 
without galea; labial palps very short, with two or three joints. 
Antennae of the length of head and prothorax, filiform, mostly with 
eight joints (five to nine). Wings mostly four, membranous, narrow, 
incumbent, with margin ciliated. Feet short, with tarsi biarticulate, 
the second joint without claw, terminated by a vesicular plantula. 

Note. Small insects living in plants, especially in flowers, which 
were first detected and described by DE GEER in the middle of the 
last century, under the name of Physapus. He then discovered 
palps ; and since the Hemiptera are destitute of these, they have been 
referred improperly to that order by several writers. Some think 
that they compose an order of their own (Thysanoptera HALIDAY, 
WESTWOOD). They differ from Orthoptera by the absence of the 
galea. The family is of uncertain position, intermediate amongst 
the Neuroptera, Orthoptera and Hemiptera. Metamorphosis incom- 
plete. 

In some the females are provided with a quadrivalve sting or borer, 
(Terebrantia HAL.), in others there is not such a borer, but the abdomen 
terminates in a tubule (Tubulifera). Some species in both sections are 
apterous.

This order is distinguished from the preceding by the complete 
metamorphosis, as also by the absence of a galea, howsoever in some 
two pairs of maxillary palps are present, and morphologically the 
innermost palps do not differ from the galea of the Orthoptera.

Simple eyes are not present in the generality of these insects; they 
occur however in some; two are met with in many small JSrachelytra, 
species of Anthophagus and Omalium (see KLUG, cited above, 
p. 280), and in Paussus bucephalus; and according to CURTIS one is 
found in the middle of the head in some Dermestidce (WESTWOOD, 
Introd. to Mod. Classif. Yol. I. p. 35). The antennae have a very 
different form and length, but consist commonly of eleven joints. 
The anterior thoracic segment is large and moveable ; the middle and 
last segments of the thorax are entirely covered above by the shield- 
covers. The under wings are absent in some species, which natu- 
rally also in that case are not able to fly, since the shield-covers are 
not used for flight ; these last are never wanting, but are sometimes 
very short. The integuments of the body are commonly hard, but 
less so on the dorsal surface, inasmuch as it is covered by the elytra. 
These insects undergo a perfect metamorphosis. The larva resem- 
bles a worm, and commonly has six horny feet *. Some larvae (Cur- 
culio, Cerambyx) have no feet, but membranous tubercles in theii 
stead. 

Of the diffusion of this order an idea may be formed when we 
reflect that, according to LATREILLE, more than fifteen years age 
about 30,000 species of beetles were known 2 , and, according tc 
WESTWOOD, in 1839, 28,000 were found in the British Museum 
alone. And how many species have there not been since then, anc 
are there not almost daily discovered ! 

The number of joints in the tarsus was first made use of 
GEOFFROY for the division of this order (Hist, abregee des Insectes, i 
pp. 50, 51), who was followed by OLIVIER (Enc. method., Hist. n. d 
Ins. Tom. v. 1791, p. 107), LATREILLE, DUMERIL, and nearly al 
modern writers ; a character, of which some have exaggerated th< 
value (see ex. gr. ILLIGER in his Magazin. f. Insektenkunde, i. 1802 
s. 285), but which has some exceptions 3 , and moreover canno 
always be strictly applied, if we would not violate natural affinity 4 
The normal number of the joints of the tarsus is in this order, as ii 
most hexapod insects, five, and therefore by far the most of th

genera belong to the Pentamera. The Heteromera are such as have 
an unequal number of joints of the tarsus in different feet, namely, 
five in the first four feet, four in the last two. The remaining 
divisions, which have been formed, are Tetramera, Trimera, Dimera 
and Monomer a; the last two, however, in consequence of later 
observations, are obsolete 1 , and there remain only the Trimera and 
Tetramera; on which we may remark, that, according to more 
accurate investigation, in the Trimera and in many Tetramera a 
small joint has been found situated at the base of the last joint, and 
which, when this joint is in its ordinary position, is almost con- 
cealed and invisible 2 . The Trimera are thus in reality Tetramera; 
they are named by WESTWOOD, Pseudotrimera (Cryptotetramera 
BUEM.). The Tetramera of LATREILLE are now named by BUE- 
MEISTEE Cryptopentamera, by WESTWOOD Pseudotetramera. The 
first three or four joints of the tarsus are commonly broad and 
below flat, furnished with small inequalities and beset with little 
hairs at the margin. The last joint (the last two joints taken 
together in the Pseudotrimera and Pseudotetramera) is small, 
inversely conical, elongate, horny and smooth, and terminates with 
curved nails or hooklets.

Tetramera and (Pseudotetramera.) 

Family XL VI. Clavipalpi. First three joints of tarsi spongy 
neath, furnished with brushes of setae, third bilobed. Antennas 
iform, or moniliform, capitate, short. Palps with last joint thick, 
ody often gibbous, mostly oval, with thorax short, narrow an- 
riorly, with head small. 

These insects (the club-palps) are very closely allied to the pre- 
ceding, wherefore WESTWOOD places them in the division of the 
Pseudotrimera as a third family. They appear to live on Fungi 
(Agaricus, Boletus). The greatest number of species belongs to 
South America.

Eyes in many emarginate, a sinus receiving the base of antennas. 

The goat-beetles, or long-horns. These insects usually live a long 
time in the state of larva and then reside in different parts of plants, 
especially in the inside in the wood, whence some species may become 
very injurious to the growth of trees. The larvae have very short 
feet, or are quite destitute of them, and are vermiform, with rings 
strongly marked as though by constriction. The goat-beetles have 
some affinity with the group of the Lucanidea amongst the lamelli- 
cornia; this is however exaggerated, when some writers wish on that 
account to place this family in the neighbourhood of Lucanus L.

rent than in the other Pseudotetramera, so that some count this genus 
amongst the Pentamera. 

The habitus of these insects resembles that of LUCANUS. LATREILLE 
first placed this genus in the neighbourhood of Cucujus (Hist. nat. det 
Crust, et des Ins. Tom. XI. p. 252) and from later writers also it received 
the same place ; the affinity however with Spondylis seems to assign tc 
Parandra a place amongst the Prionidce.

Vntennse shorter than thorax, with first joint elongate, terminal 
oints forming a club. Head often protracted anteriorly for a while. 
D alps small, conical. 

A small family of small insects, called by the Germans Borken- 
kafer, bark-beetles, although many do not live in the outer bark 
(Borke), but in the bast or liber and some in the wood. Some of 
the species cause great injury to needle-leafed trees (fir, larch, &c.) 
e larvae have no feet, any more than those of the following family, 
ith which the Scolytini, as already remarked by WESTWOOD, might 
almost be united. Also the nervous system confirms the affinity. 
In the abdomen there is no chain of ganglia, but they are all united 
to form a single ganglion oblongo-conical, which is situated close to 
the second thoracic ganglia (formed from the union of those of the 
meso- and metathorax). See the figure of the nervous system of 
Scolytus pygmceus in the memoir of BLANCHAKD Ann. des Sc. nat. 
Sie-me Serie, Tom. v. 1846, Zool PL 13, fig. 8. Some affinity with 
the Scarabce'idea cannot be mistaken.

also of the Meloeida possess the same property, which however, as is 
asserted, is not perceived in Apalus. The female lays her eggs in the 
ground ; the larvae make their appearance after about three weeks, like 
those of Meloe (and of Apalus, which are quite similar to them according 
to GENE), hitherto known in the first period of their life alone, but not in 
their further growth.

D. Pentamera. Tarsi all with five joints. 

We here employ this character only in so far as it is available for the most 
of the genera, but not as absolutely universal and exclusive. Already 
LATREILLE was obliged to admit some exceptions (Families not. du Reyne 
animal, 1825, p. 337); we subjoin still others, and do not separate, for 
instance, Pselaphus from the rest of the Brachelytra, whilst, on the other 
hand, we have placed the genera with five joints Dacne, Episcapha, and 
Triplatoma (see above, p. 470) with the Tetramera in the family of the 
Clavipalpi. 

Family LVI. Lamellicorma. Antennae clavate, short, mostly 
with nine or ten joints, inserted under the exsert margin of head. 
Club of antennae lamellate, or serrate, or tunicate, with first joint of 
club infundibuliform, including the other joints. External margin 
of the two anterior feet dentate. Mentum often large, covering the 
ligula, and bearing palps. 

Lamellicorn beetles. The insects of this group form in the 
system of LINNAEUS the genera Lucanus and Scarabceus. The larvse 
are thick, cylindrical, the posterior part of the body bent down- 



wards ; 1

wards ; besides the head there are thirteen rings ; no eyes are 
present ; the feet have four joints and a strong claw at the end. 
The pupae, which lie in a hollow clod of earth, have the cases of 
the wings projecting beyond the posterior margin of those of the 
elytra. See the beautiful figures in the Mem. sur les metamorphoses 
des Coleopteres of W. DE HAAN, Nouv. Ann. du Museum iv. 1835, 
pp. 125164, pi. 1019. 

Phalanx I. Lucanidea or Priocera. Antennas with ten joints, 
club pectinate, with lamellas sub-parallel, and almost perpendicular 
to the axis. (Elytra always covering the apex of abdomen. Ab- 
domen with only five distinct segments underneath.) 

The larvae live on decayed wood and reside in hollow stems of 
trees. This group is allied indeed to the following, but still differs 
by some anatomical characters. The larvae have a nervous system, 
of which the ganglia of the thorax and the abdomen are separated 
from each other by considerable distances ; whilst in the following 
group they lie very close together, forming as it were a varicose 
string. In the proper genus Lucanus the nervous system of the 
perfect insect has quite a different form from that of the Scarabceida; 
the second and third thoracic ganglia are separated from each other, 
and the abdomen has six distinct ganglia, whilst in the Scarabceida 
the second and third thoracic ganglia are fused together, and in the 
abdomen, in place of a chain of ganglia, a single central nervous mass 
alone succeeds to this thoracic ganglion, from which mass the nerves 
of the abdomen arise at acute angles (like the last spinal nerves in 
the Cauda equina of mammals). 

See the, figures of BLANCHARD Ann. des Sc. not., ^idme Sgrie, Tom. v. 
PI. 8, fig. i, in Lucanus cervus, and in CUVIER R. An. ed. ill., Ins. PI. 3, 
in the cockchafer. As perfect insect Passalus follows the Scarabceida in 
the form of the nervous system, and therefore is referred by BLANCHARD to 
this group, and separated from Lucanus. 

A. Ligula membranous, mostly bilobed and penicillate. Antenna smooth, 
mostly broken, with first joint elongate. Scutellum between the base of elytra 
at the beginning of the suture. 

Lucanus L. (in part). Mandibles exsert beyond head, mostly 
much larger in males, porrect. Labrum mostly conjoined with 
iclypeus or none. Maxillas membranous. Antennae broken. Feet 
often elongate, especially the anterior. Body somewhat de- 
j pressed. 



506 CLASS VIII. 

The Stag-beetles. The genus Lucanus, although from the 
characters given above much more limited here than with LINNAEUS, 
still contains different genera of modern authors which it is 
impossible for us to set forth here. The under jaws are commonly 
membranous ; in the females alone of some exotic species the 
innermost lobe (mandd) has a horny hooklet at the extremity 1 . In 
some species the eyes are completely divided by a projecting flat 
margin of the head into two, one situated on the upper and one on 
the under side of the head.

agreeing in form, and coloured brown or black; they are in great part 
found in S. America and the islands of the Indian Archipelago and South 
Sea ; in JBurope and North Africa none of them are found. The larva has 
much resemblance to that of Lucanus, but the last pair of feet is replaced 
by two small conical tubercles, as was first remarked by PEECHERON. 
BUEMEISTER gave a more complete description of the larva and the pupa in 
his excellent Handbuch d. Entomol. v. s. 454, 459. 

Note. To this family of insects genus Trictenotoma GRAY was 
formerly referred by English authors. Now, however, it is more 
correctly referred to the Longicornia by DUPONT and also by WEST- 
WOOD, where it is to be placed after genus Prionus (above, p. 480) 
as an anomalous genus. By the number of joints of the tarsi it 
belongs to the Heteromera. Antennae longer than head and thorax, 
eleven-jointed, with first joint elongate, three last incrassate, forming 
internally a sub-serrate club.

Phalanx II. Scarabceidea or Petalocera. Club of antennae 
lamellate or tunicate. 

These insects form with LINK<EUS the genus Scarabceus. They 
compose one of the most numerous divisions of the Coleoptera, 



INSECTA. 509 

which amongst the Pentamera 1 is surpassed by the Carabici alone. 
Many large species belong to it, which are armed with knobs, 
horns and other excrescences on the head or thorax. As the horns 
amongst the ruminant mammals are often appropriated to the male 
individuals, so here also these excrescences are mostly wanting in the 
females, or much less developed. These insects live for the most part 
on plants, some on decaying parts of vegetables or on animal dung. 
The larvze live long; some change into nymphs only after three or 
four years. The intestinal canal of the perfect insect is commonly 
very long, and the stomach forms the chief part of it, (see above, 
p. 253). The vessels for secreting urine are long, four in number, 
and so much convoluted round the intestinal canal that their termi- 
nation is found with difficulty. In the larvae the stomach is short, 
wide, and surrounded by three rings of blind appendages, which 
however are wanting in the larvae of Aphodius, (DE HAAN Nouv. 
Ann. du Mus. iv. pi. 18, fig. 4). The small intestine is very short, 
and the large extensive and wide, filling the whole space of the body 
behind. The air-tubes of the perfect insect form, especially in the 
abdomen, many larger or smaller vesicular expansions, by which 
these animals, notwithstanding their size, are often very light, which 
increases their capacity for flying.

shield-covers next the hind feet leaves generally a part of the 
margin of the abdomen visible j the wings, since the insect flies 
with closed elytra, pass through the excision.

B. Anthobia (Glaphyridce MAC L.). Elytra shorter than abdo- 
men, mostly dehiscent towards the apex. Last dorsal segment of 
abdomen (pygidium) surpassing elytra. Antennas with nine or ten 
joints, club three-leafed. Mandibles horny, membranous on the 
inner side alone. Maxilla with process membranous, often elongate 
and hirsute. Ligula free, membranous, bipartite, produced beyond 
the horny mentum. 

A small group of beetles, of which FABRICIUS brought the species 
known to him to the genus Melolontha, but which has just as much 
affinity to Tnchius. Most of the species are from the old world, especially 
from the south of Africa, some are met with also in the south of Europe 
(Italy, Portugal). Some species are very hairy ; in some the males are 
distinguished by very long hind-feet with thick thighs ; the booklets of 
the four first feet are mostly bifid. Most of the species are small, between 
3'" and 5'" ; only few are half an inch or more in size.

leaves at the club of antennas, the female with six shorter ; thorax black 
with a white felt ; stone-coloured or red-brown shield-covers. The larva 
lives three years underground, and destroys the roots of plants ; in the 
autumn of the fourth year it changes into a nymph, from which the beetle, 
that lives on leaves of all kinds of trees, after some weeks makes its 
appearance, but commonly continues under ground until May. This 
insect in some years appears in large numbers, and causes dreadful damage, 
as for instance, according to the newspapers, in 1836, around Quedlimburg, 
where, in the middle of May, 132 Dutch mud (of four bushels) were col- 
lected. Another species, somewhat smaller, with reddish-brown thorax, of 
the same colour as the shield-covers, Melol. Hippocastani FABE. (PANZER 
Deutschl. Ins. Heft 97, Tab. 6, RCESEL 1. 1. figs. 9, 10) is met with in this

ith club lamellate, always with three joints. Mandibles princi- 

illy horny, produced at the apex beyond the clypeus, armed with 

tooth at the base, mostly supplied internally with a border mem- 

anous, ciliated, narrow. Ligula horny, connate with mentum. 

brum covered by clypeus. Claws mostly equal (except those of 

terior tarsi in males of some species). Scutellum distinct, moderate 

small, broad, triangular, with apex rotundate. 

These insects often present a great difference of form in the two 
sexes, the head and thorax in the male being armed with horny 
excrescences, which in the female are less developed or entirely 
absent. They are usually brown or black in colour ; some exotic 
species are amongst the largest of beetles. The larvae live in decay-

Note. Here are to be placed, according to ERICHSON, genera 
jEgialia LATH., and Chiron MAC L. ; they differ however, in the 
labrum and mandibles being horny ; wherefore they ought to be 
counted with the preceding section of the Arenicolce as by LATKEILLE. 
jEgialia is enumerated by WESTWOOD with the Trogidce ; Chiron, 
on account of a certain similarity of habit, is considered by many 
to be allied to the Passali.

live in old wood, and render our furniture wormeaten, by small round holes, 
from which a fine yellow powdered wood falls. The larva lives in these 
cylindrical passages, and resembles, like that of Apate, the larva of the 
cockchafer in miniature (see fig. of the larva of Anob. tessellatum in KATZE- 
BURG Forst-Ins. I. Tab. II. fig. 19, of Apate ibid. Tab. XIV. fig. 33). This 
little beetle causes a ticking sound in the wood, from which vulgar super- 
stition derives an unfavourable omen, as appears from the names Todtenuhr, 
Vhorloge de la mort, Death-watch. Another smaller, red-brown species, 
Anobium paniceum, Dermestes paniceus L., PANZER Deutschl. Ins. Heft 66,

This species, and some others (Lampyris noctiluca L., Lamp, hemiptera, 
Lamp, italica, &c.), diffuse a phosphoric light by night ; the males shine 
less than the females, and with them the light ceases after the pairing ; the 
females, on the other hand, are very luminous when laying eggs. G. R. 
TREVIRANUS was of opinion that the light proceeded from the internal 
genital organs; this subject is fully treated by him Biologic, v. s. 105 
1 1 6, Verm. Schriften, I. s. 87 93. The light becomes dull in carbonic 
acid and hydrogen gases, and stronger in oxygen gas; see on these and 
other particulars a letter of MATTEUCCI to DUMAS in the Comptes rendus, 
14 Aug. 1843.

Spring -beetles. When these animals are touched, they retract their feet 
considerably. Since the feet are very short, these beetles, when laid on 
their back, are not able to reach the ground, and so could not right them- 
selves again, if they could not by throwing {hemselves upwards attempt to 
regain their feet. The animal, lying on its back, bends the thorax towards 
the back or downwards, and thus causes the style of the prothorax to 
emerge from the cavity in which it lies when at rest. Then bending the 
body suddenly, so that the point again shoots into the cavity, the insect 
with the back part of the thorax forcibly strikes the ground, and is thrown 
upwards by the rebound. 

The larvae live under the bark of trees, in decaying wood, or under 
ground, where they gnaw roots. They have an elongate cylindrical body 
with six feet and a very hard horny skin.

Amongst the numerous exotic species we note only Elater (Pyrophorus 
ILLIG.) noctilucus L., VOET Coleopt. i. Tab. 43, fig. 16; it has on each 
side of the thorax a smooth yellow spot ; by night it emits a clear light, 
which radiates principally from the spots on the thorax (comp. TKEVIRANUS 
Biologie, v. s. 100 103, 475). This, with other phosphorescent species (see 
KIRBY and SPENCE Introd. n. pp. 410 412), is found in South America. 
Comp. GERMAR Zeitschr. f. Entomol. in. 1841, s. i 76, J. CURTIS in 
Zool. Journal, in. 1828, pp. 379 382. 

[A fine specimen of Elater noctilucus, which had been imported in a cargo 
of logwood, came into VAN DER HCEVEN'S possession after it had lived some 
weeks in other hands. He kept it alive for a fortnight. The phosphorescent 
spots were, in the dark, first blue, then emerald green, then incandescent. 
Large printing could be read by the light, but it was necessary to carry the 
insect along the lines to read continuously. In oxygen gas the luminosity 
was not more splendid. Experiments to determine whether the tempera- 
ture rose with the phosphorescence were interrupted by the death of the 
animal. On dissection, nothing peculiar was observed beneath the spots on 
the thorax, except . large or smaller masses of the adipose body connected 
by numerous tracheae. The Professor thinks it not impossible that the 
production of light may not be confined to a particular region, but may 
occur wherever the adipose body occupies the spaces between the organs in 
sufficient mass, and is adequately supplied with air-tubes. The two spots 
on the thorax, though destitute of the brown colouring matter, are of the 
same thickness as the neighbouring integument. Does this thickness, the 
Professor asks, account for the transmission of the green light, whilst that 
which proceeds occasionally from parts of the inferior surface, where the 
membrane is thin, is yellow ? However this may be, the adipose body must 
be very unequally phosphorescent, otherwise the light from the under 



INSECTA. 527 

surface would be always as strong as that from the upper. But it is 
' produced only rarely, and when the animal makes much exertion. See

528 CLASS YIII. 

Family L1X. Brachelytra (Microptera GKAVENIIORST). An- 
tennae mostly moniliform, of the same thickness towards the apex, 
or thicker at the apex. Elytra much shorter than abdomen, en- 
tirely covering the wings which are long and replicate, not dehis- 
cent. Body mostly narrow, elongate, arcuate upwards, the insect 
running. Dorsal segments of abdomen all horny. 

Most of these insects live in offal, dung, or under decaying plants. 
They live on animal substances, especially other insects ; so also the 
larvae, which are elongate, with a large head and six strong feet. 
The intestinal canal of these beetles is straight and short ; there are 
four vasa urinaria. The similarity of these beetles with the genus 
Forficula amongst the Orthoptera (see above, p. 462, 463) is rather 
external and does not rest upon a natural affinity in the internal 
structure. 

The species of this family are very numerous, and in Europe far 
surpass even those of the Carabici. However, this is quite other- 
wise with the exotic species hitherto known, and hence some writers 
are of opinion that this family is eminently a form of the northern 
hemisphere. Perhaps this may be a hasty conclusion, and the 
rarity of Staphylini from warm countries, in our collections, may in 
part be attributed to the inadvertence of travelling collectors.

termse brown. This beetle flies with elytra erect, the under-side turned 
outwards ; it diffuses a strong smell resembling musk. Like Geotrupes 
Stercorarius and vernalis it is sometimes infested by small acari. The 
periods of larva and nymph together extend only to seven weeks. This 
species, like the others of this genus, feeds on dead animal substances. By 
an union of their forces these beetles dig away the ground from under the 
carcases of small animals, moles, mice, &c. and so bury them beneath it. 
They lay their eggs in the bodies thus interred, and the larvae feed on them.

species of this genus i| to if inches long, pitch-black, shining, the 
antennae and feelers red-brown ; the thorax terminating in a sharp point 
between the hind-feet. This beetle lives in fresh water, and feeds especially 
as perfect insect, yet also as larva, on water-slugs, and swims very quickly. 
The abdomen is covered beneath with a stratum of air, as though with 
silver. This air (a provision for respiration) is renewed by the beetle, by 
means of air-bubbles taken up on his antennae, which he brings from time 
to time to the surface of the water (NiTZSCH in REIL'S Archiv f. d. 
Physiol. x. p. 440). The female spins for her eggs an oblong, pod-shaped 
nest of a yellow-brown colour, terminating above in a little curved horn, 
which floats on the water amongst the duckweed. In this the eggs lie in 
regular order. The young larvae, some time after they have come forth 
perforate this web, and cast themselves into the water. See LYONET in his 
translation of LESSER, Theologie des Ins. I. p. 159, fig. xvi. and Ouvrage

This genus forms the transition to the following family, and from the form 
of the under-jaws belongs to the neighbourhood of Gyrinus. 

Family LXII. Hydrocantharina or Dytiscina. Maxillae homy, 
with external lacinia palpiform, articulate. Mandibles, as to the 
greatest part, covered. Four posterior feet natatory, two posterior 
remote from the rest. Body oval , thorax broad, transverse.

Gyrinus GEOFFR., L. Antennas shorter than head, fusiform, 
with nine joints, auriculate at the base. Eyes divided by the 
lateral margin of head into two parts quite separate. Anterior 
feet long, porrect ; four posterior feet short, broad. Elytra poste- 
riorly rotundate, not covering the apex of abdomen.

Sp. Gyrinus natator L., E(ESEL Ins. in. Tab. xxxi., PANZER Deutschl. Ins. 
Heft 3, Tab. 5, AHRENS et GERMAR faun. Ins. Europ. n. Tab. 5 ; the 
male 2'", the female 3'" long, blue-black, shining ; the shields are stippled 
in longitudinal rows. These whirling beetles make their appearance early in 
spring in fresh water, revolving in circles on the surface of the water with 
much rapidity. On the least alarm they dive suddenly below. Several other 
European species are figured in AHRENS and GERMAR Faun. Ins. Eur. 
Tab. II. 



INSECT A. 543 

In Orectochilus (Gyrinus villosus FABB., STUBM Deutschl. Ins. x. Tab. 
227) the outermost palpiform lobe of the under-jaws is wanting, and thus 
they have only one feeler. So also in many large exotic species. Hence 
this character of the family is not constant, but the agreement of habitus 
does not permit these species to be placed elsewhere. 

B. Abdomen composed of seven segments, the first three connate. 

Dytiscus L. (exclusive of the Hydrophili, Dytiscus GEOFFR.). 
Antennae longer than head, filiform or setaceous, with eleven joints. 
Eyes marginal. Head retracted within thorax as far as the 
posterior margin of eyes. Posterior coxae ample. Maxillae arcuate, 
acuminate ; external maxillary palps with last joint oval, larger, 
thicker or truncated.

PI. 5, figs. 3, 4; 15'" long, feet and body red-brown, thorax and shield- 
covers gleaming black, a yellow-brown border along all the sides of the 
thorax and along the outer edge of shield- covers ; the female (Dytiscus 
semistriatus L.) has longitudinal furrows on the shield-covers more than half 
their length. The females also of other species are distinguished by simi- 
larly striated elytra, although in some of these females with smooth shield- 
covers occur. The first three joints of the tarsi of the fore-feet form in the 
male a round disc which is haired on the margin, and supplied with suckers 
below. Dytiscus (Acilius) sulcatus L., PANZEB Deutschl. Ins. Heft 31, 
Tab. 9, 10, STUBM 1. 1. Tab. 189, &c. 

The larvae of these water-beetles have a large oval head, armed with 
strong curved jaws, three pairs of thin haired feet, and two appendages at 
the hind part of the body subservient to respiration. They are very vora- 
cious, and like the larvae of libellae are incessantly on the hunt for other 
water-insects. The nymphs lie concealed in the ground under the water. 
The perfect insects breathe on the surface of the water, by extending the 
abdomen above it, and raising the shield- covers a little, whilst the head 
is kept under. 

The intestinal canal does not undergo any remarkable change in the 
metamorphosis. The four vessels that secrete urine are especially long, 
the rectum has a lateral appendage, membranous and folded. Below the 
rectum are the openings of vessels which secrete a milky fluid. KAMDOIIR

Iternal lacinia palpiform). Mandibles exsert. Maxillae incurved at 
'the apex. Antennae thin, filiform. Body mostly oblong, with 
thorax cordate, oval or quadrate. Abdomen composed of six seg- 
ments, the three first connate. 

A numerous family, in which DEJEAN in 1839 distinguished 
nearly 2,800 species, and which with LINNAEUS consisted of two 
genera Carabus and Cicindela numbering together, in the last 
edition of the Sy sterna Naturce, only 57 species.

Phalanx I. Ligula porrect (often augmented by lateral ap- 
pendages or paraglossae). Apex of maxilla (with few exceptions) 
without hook distinct, articulate. Labial palps with three joints, 
set upon labium by means of a peduncle elongate, immoveable. 
Head not broader than thorax, mostly narrower. Many species 
ipterous. (Carabicina in the stricter sense, Carabidce LEACH, 
WESTW.) 

Running-beetles, earth-beetles. Most of the species live under- 
ground, under stones, under bark of trees. They run very swiftly. 

The oasophagus is at its origin narrow, but it soon expands 
largely ; to this crop succeeds the muscular stomach and a long 
narrow stomach beset with villi, at the inferior extremity of which 
the four vessels secreting urine are implanted. The small intestine 
is short, the rectum oval and wide. RAMDOHR, op. cit. pp. 82 84,

The larvae have a longitudinal body, divided into twelve rings, 
without counting the head. The first ring (prothorax) is horny ; 
the last has two conical, horny, or membranous appendages. The 
head has strong jaws, six simple eyes on each side, and two antennae 
consisting of four joints. The six feet are of moderate length, with 
two hooklets at the extremity.

Different species of the typical genus of this division, Brachinus 
(Aptinus BONELLI), eject for their defence an acrid fluid from the 
anus, which presently evaporates with an explosion and causes an 
inflammation on the skin. Hence the name of Bombardier-beetle. 

ROLANDER gave the first account of this peculiarity in the Transactions 
of the Academy of Stockholm for 1750. See, on the parts which secrete 
the fluid, LEON DUFOUR, Ann. du Museum, xvm. 1811, pp. 70 81, PL 5

CLASS IX. 
ARACHNIDS (ARACHNOIDS A) 1 . 

THE Arachnids were counted by LINNAEUS, as was stated above 
(p. 248) , to belong to the class of insects. They were first separated 
from these as a distinct class by LAMARCK (1801), who placed all 
the wingless insects of LINNAEUS, which undergo no transformation 
and breathe by air-slits, in his class of the Arachnida 2 . To this 
then the myriapods, spring-tails, and parasites, would also belong, 
which we have placed amongst the insects (pp. 288 303), and 
LAMARCK accordingly divides his Arachinida into those which 
have antennas, and those which are without these parts. It is the 
last alone, which we, following LATREILLE, refer to this class. 

The class of arachnids, thus limited, is a very well defined and 
natural division of the animal kingdom. The arachnids are arti- 
culate animals with articulate feet or legs (see pp. 33, 248) and 
without antennae. The head is with them joined to the thorax, so

to form a single piece, to which LATREILLE has given the name 
of Cephalothorax : to this piece alone are the feet attached. Be- 
hind the cephalothorax is connected with the abdomen, the second 
principal piece of the body. A longitudinal arterial heart or dorsal 
vessel is present, and in many a more or less developed vascular 
system for the circulation of blood. Respiration is effected either 
by means of air-tubes, as in insects, or of lungs in determinate 
parts of the body. In all, however, there are lateral openings or 
air-slits (see above, p. 260, 261), which conduct to the respiratory 
organs. The sexes are distinct. 

According to the theory of SAVIGNY, no oral parts are present 
in this class, which correspond to the upper and lower jaws of 
insects. The parts, which in spiders and scorpions are usually 
called upper jaws (mandibles], are, according to SAVIGNY, to be 
compared with the second pair of auxiliary jaws, or feet changed 
into jaws in the cray-fish and other ten-footed crustaceans. In 
some arachnids these parts undergo such a change, that they 
assume a flattened form and compose a sucker. The under-jaws 

i which succeed these, and which in the scorpions sustain large shear- 
shaped feelers, are, according to SAVIGNY, to be compared with the 
third pair of auxiliary jaws, or feet changed into jaws of decapod 
crustaceans. To these, in the arachnids, four pairs of feet succeed, 

v of which the first pair, according to the same writer, corresponds to 
the second pair of untransformed feet of decapod crustaceans. The 
untransformed first pair of feet of the decapod crustaceans, the so- 
called chelce or shears of cray-fish and crabs, would thus, like the 

i proper jaws (mandibles), be wanting in arachnids 1 . The abdomen 
is never provided with feet. 



1 This view, however, is not altogether free from objection. Thus LATREILLE con- 
siders the first pair of jaws (the upper-jaws) of arachnids to be modified antennae. 
[EKICHSON rejects this opinion of LATREILLE ; EntomograpTiien, erstes Heft. Berlin, 
1840, s. 9; OWEN, on the contrary, on the ground of the origin of the nerves distributed 
to these parts, defends it. Lectures on Comp. Anat. I. 1843, p. 253, 2nd edit. p. 448.] 
Still more may it be doubted whether the first pair of feet of arachnids really corresponds 
to the second pair of unaltered feet in decapod crustaceans ; this comparison may be 
looked on as merely an arbitrary conception. Rather does the opinion deserve the 
preference, that these parts correspond to the lateral parts of the under-lip. [This 
opinion, I think, was first offered by W. DE HAAN in an essay, of which the other 
propositions appear to me to be less happy, entitled: Vergelijking tusschen de tast- 
kaauw-en bewegings-werktuigen der gelede dicren in VAN HALL, VROLIK and MULDER, 
Bijdragen tot de natuurk. Wetensch. n. 1827, bl. 134, afterwards by DUGES Ann. dcs 



558 CLASS ix. 

The feet or legs of arachnids do not present exactly the same 
typus as those of insects. They consist usually of seven joints, and 
are not thinner towards the extremity, so that the tarsi differ less 
from the other parts than in insects. If we suppose that the two 
last joints belong to the tarsus, then the tibia consists of two joints 
of which the first in some is the longest (e.g. Scorpio and Phrynus), 
in others the second. The long joint that precedes it is the femur 
which succeeds a short, inversely conical joint corresponding to the 
trochanter in hexapod insects. The first joint, broader, commonly 
inversely conical, by which the feet are attached to the cephalo- 
thorax, corresponds to the hip (coxa) of insects. In Plirynm, the 
tarsus of the fore legs consists of a great number of joints (thirty 
and more), of extraordinary fineness, and in the remaining feet of 
three joints. The last joint of the tarsus has usually two curved 
booklets, and in some a membranous or vesicular cushion (pulmllus) 
in addition at the under side. What is most distinctive in the com- 
position of the feet in arachnids, is the division of the tibia into 
two pieces. In Phrynus, the tibia of the fore-feet, like the tarsus, 
consists of numerous thin joints ; those of the second and third pairs 
of feet of the usual number, two ; those of the fourth pair of five, of 
which the first exceeds the rest in length remarkably. 

The cephalothorax often presents a line or groove on each side 
of the simple eyes placed in the middle, indicating an imperfect 
separation, so that the head looks like a wedge or triangle, with the 
point turned backwards, upon the thorax. The upper surface of 

Sc. not. 2e SeVie, I. Zoolog. p. 7, and by ERICHSON, Entomogr. s. 8.] In the scorpions 
there are two horny triangular plates between the first pair of feet, which may be 
regarded as mentum, a part wanting in the rest of the anachnids. An upper lip 
(labrum) is not present in these any more than in the rest. According to this view 
arachnids would have only three pairs of feet, like most insects. Yet Zoology must 
nevertheless still continue to assert that arachnids have four pairs of feet, since, in 
reality, four pairs of jointed appendages of the cephalothorax do always act as feet. 
Even the jaws of hexapod insects are in a wider sense modified feet. Feet and jaws 
are parts having the same fundamental form. This is proved by the history of develop- 
ment. Both these parts are, according to the investigation of KATHKE in the Cray-fish, 
of the same form, and the dissimilarity between feet and jaws, which is seen in perfect 
cray-fishes, is merely the consequence of subsequent development (Untersuchungen tiler 
die Bildung u. EntwicTcelung des Flusskrebses, Leipsig, 1829, fol. s. 67, 68). In young 
and still imperfect individuals of Cyclops quadricornis, according to the figures of 
JURINE, the upper jaws and the last pair of under jaws serve for swimming, and have 
much resemblance to the feet which are developed only at a later period. RATHKE loc. 
cit. p. 73. 



ARACHNIDS. 559 

the thorax consists of a lamina, in which sometimes, more or less 
obviously, four sutures or grooves are seen, which proceed obliquely 
from the feet to the center, and indicate the original composition of 
the thorax of four pieces. On the under surface, between the coxse 
of the feet, is a lamina, which may be considered as sternum, formed 
I of the union of four pieces. The abdomen of the Scorpions, of 
Phrynus and Telephonus and (amongst the Arachnoidea trachearia) 
of OUsium is divided into rings; in others, as the spiders, it is 
without rings, and has a much softer integument than the cephalo- 
thorax. On the whole, the external covering of the Arachnids is 
soft and very extensible ; the skin is horny and hard in Scorpio, 
Fhrynus, in some JEpeirce (Epeira cancriformis) , &c. Two layers 
may usually be distinguished in the skin ; the external is firmer, 
sometimes cellular, often provided with sinuous folds ; the internal 
consists of a finely granular substance or of very delicate fibres, be- 
neath which is a layer of pigment. In Mygale, these pigment cells 
are very apparent. The external membrane exhibits many concen- 
tric rings with spots between them, which, under the microscope, 
present a deceptive resemblance to the corpuscles and lamellae of 
bone. 

The intestinal canal of the arachnids proceeds without tortu- 
osities to the posterior extremity of the body. Not in all of them, 
however, is the anus situated at the posterior extremity, but in the 
Acari more forward on the ventral surface 1 . In Phrynus and 
Scorpio, the intestine is a narrow canal, nearly of the same width 
throughout. In all the other Arachnids, the intestinal canal has 
many protrusions or blind appendages of very different form ; and 
in many Acarina these appendages are ramified, reminding us of 
the form of the intestine in Planarice and Distomata. In the Pyc- 
nogonida blind appendages proceed from the stomach, even into the 
shear-shaped feelers and the feet. In the genus Phalangium the 
intestinal canal forms a wide sac, which has in front, on each side, 
five blind appendages that become wider towards the extremity, of 
jwhich. the last pair is longer than the rest, and descends to the 
^termination of the intestinal canal. Between these appendages are 
still twelve others smaller and vesicular, and at the hindmost part 



1 See the figure of Ixodes, Acarus americanus (or crenattis KOLLAR) in TREVIRA- 
KDS, Zeitschr. fur Physiol. iv. i. 1832. 



560 CLASS IX. 

of the intestinal canal there are in addition four small blind appen- 
dages on each side 1 . In the spiders (Aranea L.) the oesophagus is 
narrow, horny, bent first downwards, then upwards, and terminates 
in a part which proceeds backwards, and can be dilated by muscles 
attached to it 2 . This part becomes at its extremity more membra- 
nous, and passes into the intestinal canal, which sends two lateral 
arms forwards that bend themselves round in the cephalothorax 
and approach each other or unite so as to form an annular stomach. 
From this ring blind eversions proceed towards the feet, bend 
downwards, and communicate with each other. From the same 
point where the two lateral arms arise a middle canal exists, which 
runs towards the abdomen and is gradually dilated in some degree. 
The widened part receives on each side two large canals which 
branch through the adipose body ; the intestinal canal then narrower 
curves upwards and afterwards proceeds downwards, where, pre- 
vious to its termination, an oval coecum is situated laterally. 

Organs of different form for the secretion of saliva are observed 
in most genera of this class, and probably are wanting in none of 
the arachnids, although their opening into the intestinal canal hasi 
not been detected in all. In the Scorpions, where MECKEL S de- 
nied altogether the existence of salivary organs, two longitudinal 
sacs placed in the fore part of the abdominal cavity, their tortuous 
canals running forwards in the cephalothorax, probably serve for 
the secretion of saliva 4 . From the secretion of saliva the poison 
should be distinguished, with which different species kill their prey 
previous to devouring it. In the spiders there is situated at the 
base of each of the mandibles, or sometimes in the mandibles them- 
selves, a vesicle, surrounded by a layer of flat spirally turned fila- 
ments, from the anterior part of which a narrow duct arises, that 
runs towards the point of the upper jaw. This poison has an effect

iften rapidly mortal upon those insects on which spiders feed, and 
iven large flies die quickly when they have been wounded on a 
jingle foot alone by the bite of Clubiona air ox 1 . 

We have seen that in the spiders, 'from the dilatation of the 
ntestinal canal situated in the abdomen, which might be taken for 
he hindmost stomach, large canals proceed to the adipose body. 
Similarly in the scorpions from the intestinal canal, at nearly equal 
d very large distances from each other, there arise on each side 
ve transverse branches which subdivide into finer branches and 
on through the granular adipose mass. Already, when treating of 

Class of Insects, we directed attention to the suggestion that 
icre perhaps the adipose body assumed the place of the liver 
3. 257). In most arachnids (Scorpio, Aranea L.) this part cer- 
ainly, with still stronger claim, deserves to be thus considered 2 , 
t consists of lobes, formed of small blind vesicles united in clusters, 
nd filled with cells. The ducts in question, which run towards 

intestinal canal or proceed from it as branching eversions, are 
be considered then as gall-ducts. In other arachnids (Phalan- 
ita, Acarina, Arctisca and Pycnogonida) the glandular walls of the 
lind intestinal appendages probably serve for the secretion of bile 3 . 

In most arachnids there exist also thin tubes with blind ex- 
remities which correspond to the Malpighian vessels of insects (see 
bove, pp. 255, 256), and so are to be considered as subservient to 

urinary secretion. They differ, however, from the vessels of 
isects alluded to, inasmuch as they usually divide into many 
ranches. 

The organs for respiration and the circulation of blood are not 
i these animals formed after one and the same type. When 
aspiration is performed by means of air-tubes, there is a dorsal 
ssel, as in insects, a longitudinal heart, without branches ; vessels, 
Li the other hand, are found in those genera in which the respira- 
>ry organs are sacciform lungs, and are not spread throughout the 
ody as air-tubes. In Phalangium, the heart is a dorsal vessel 
'ithout branches, which becomes narrower at both extremities, 
id is divided by constrictions into three chambers, or dilata-

tions 1 . In many of the inferior arachnids neither heart nor vesseL 
have been met with. 

In the spiders and scorpions, on the contrary, there are vessels 
present for the circulation of the blood. The heart has, indeed, stil 
the form of a longitudinal vessel, but other vessels arise from it 
whilst from the respiratory organs the returning arterialised blooc 
penetrates the heart through lateral, transverse fissures on the 
upper or dorsal surface, which are provided with valves. The 
course of these~returning vessels, corresponding to the pulmonar} 
veins of the human body, is not yet perfectly understood. Pro- 
bably the whole heart is surrounded by a sinus, into which the 
arterial blood is poured, before it penetrates the above-men tionec 
fissures. Vessels also from the heart proceed to the respirator} 
organs, but these probably serve for their nutrition, and not foi 
respiration. The heart of arachnids is then, beyond doubt, ar 
arterial heart, like that of Crustacea and of mottusca 2 . 

We have already said that the respiratory organs are in soni( 
arachnids air-tubes, in others pulmonary sacs. In both cases th( 
air has access to the respiratory organs by air-slits (stigmata], as ir 
insects ; but these stigmata are always in less number than ir 
most insects. In some arachnids no respiratory organs at all have 
been discovered (Pycnogonum, the so-named tardigrada, man} 
Acari). In these also no stigmata are present. Sometimes, indeed 
parts have been taken for stigmata, which have an entirely different 
signification ; I allude to two rows of spots on the back, which arc 
for the attachment of muscles, which, connecting the dorsal and 
ventral surfaces, contract the abdomen, and which we also meel 
with again in Limulus, amongst the Crustacea 5 . In the scorpions

3 The most complete description of the heart and vessels of the scorpions has been 
given by NEWPOKT in Phil. Transact, for 1843, Part I. pp. 286 298, with beautiful 
figures. From the dorsal vessel, that as an aorta springs from the heart at the fore part, 
there arises, before the origin of the arteries for the last pair of feet, an artery on each 
side, which passes beneath the oesophagus ; the two form a single vessel lying on the 
nervous cord. It is this artery which was described by TREVIRANUS as a third nervous 
cord, and by MUELLER as a ligament. Under the nervous cord in the abdomen a 
venous trunk is situated. 

8 This mistake was made even by the celebrated TREVIRANUS in Chelifer (Verm. 
Schr. I. s. 18, 19, Tab. n. figs. 6, 7, A), who could not on that account find any air- 
tubes there. 



ARACHNIDS. 563 

[the air-slits are obliquely transverse fissures on the ventral plates 
| of the abdomen. The uppermost or anterior lip of these slits 
covers in some degree the lower, from which last a membranous 
largin arises, which bears the respiratory organ situated in a 
all cavity. This lung (or gill) consists here, as in spiders, in 
Thelyphonus and Phrynus, of a number of double, very thin plates 
lying upon each other. If now, as is asserted, the air on respira- 
ion really penetrates this chamber so as to fill the spaces between 
;he duplicatures, then the name of lung would be justifiable 1 . The 
rdinary position of the stigmata is on the inferior surface of the 
:ppermost part of the abdomen. There also AuDOUiN discovered 
? our stigmata in the genus Chelifer that breathes by air-tubes 2 , 
'he Phalangia that also breathe by air-tubes have only a single 
iair of stigmata. In Ixodes LYONET and AUDOUIN found the two 
itigmata furnished with a plate, and upon it, besides a larger open- 
ig, many other smaller ones with a stellate margin 3 . In spiders 
the stigma is not always a simple fissure, as in the scorpions, 
.t is sometimes closed by a plate perforated like a sieve 4 . The 
L ea3 of arachnids differ often from those of insects by the 
.bsence of the spiral thread. Usually also they are parcelled in 
lundles, and not divided into branches. However, in Phalangium, 
system of air-tubes is met with divided into branches and spread 
.roughout the body, and provided also with a spiral thread. 
iere are two wide principal stems which, running forwards in the 
ihalothorax obliquely towards each other, divide into branches, 
list a transverse branch on the inside, behind the thoracic gan- 
ion, forms an arch by uniting with that of the opposite side. In 
.e abdomen, behind the stigmata, the lateral principal branches do 
it continue their course, but three smaller branches alone from the 
incipal stem penetrate backwards on each side 5 . 



1 Not on account of respiring in air ; for all animals that live in air have not lungs, 

land-crabs, for example, have gills. The respiratory organs of the ffolotkurice, 

the other hand, although these animals inhale water, are formed after the typus 

lungs.

The male and female organs of propagation are, with the excep- 
tion of the Tardigrada, in all arachnids distinct, and not united in the 
same individual. The ovaries are usually two sacs that are some- 
times connected in the middle ; the oviduct is constantly an imme- 
diate continuation of the ovary. In Phalangium the ovary consists 
of a tortuous, circular tube connected with a wide sac, in which the 
eggs await for a time their further development. From this sac a 
second oviduct arises, which running tortuously first backwards 
then forwards, terminates in the ovipositor. This ovipositor con- 
sists of horny transverse filaments, bound mutually together by a 
tough elastic membrane. It can be protruded by muscles through 
the external sexual opening situated between the hind feet 1 . In 
the scorpions, the internal female organs of propagation consist of 
three tubes running longitudinally ; the middle tube is united with 
the lateral by three transverse branches; the two lateral tubes, 
moreover, unite with each other in an arch below. They extend 
farther forwards than the middle tube and thus form two oviducts 
as their immediate continuation, which open at the external sexual 
aperture under a valve between the base of the third and fourth 
pair of feet. Here each of these oviducts, before it terminates, 
forms a roundish expansion, which may be considered as a recepta- 
culum semmis 2 . 

The male organs of propagation consist of two blind saccules or 
two tortuous and blind canals ; in others of two bundles or of a single 
group of numerous blind saccules or tubules, as in Phalangium. In 
the scorpions two loops or tortuous strings of a narrow canal, with 
two transverse canals, are found. The vas deferens also receives the 
openings of two blind sacs before reaching the external sexual aper- 
ture, which is in the same situation as that of the female. Here is

bund a small papilla, which may be considered as the rudiment of 
a penis. Also in some Acarina a short penis is present. In Pha- 
'angium, on the other hand, there is a long horny penis which can 
be extended from the body at the same part as the ovipositor in 
;he female, and through which the ductus ejaculatorius extends ; 
it the upper extremity of the glans is a small hooklet. In the 
spiders the two efferent vessels, arising from the blind tubes that 
secrete the seed, run towards the base of the abdomen, where they 
>pen, without any copulative organ, between the gills. The organ 
f copulation lies very distant from this opening. In the spiders, 
tamely, the last joint of the feeler is excavated like a spoon, with 
various appendages in addition, different in different species, and a 
iorny, curved filament connected, which lies concealed in the exca- 
vation, and can be extruded from it. With this club of fat palpi, 
;he male, at the time of pairing, touches the sexual parts of the 
emale, having previously moistened it with a drop of seminal fluid 
rom the opening of the vasa deferentia. This is thus the copula- 
ion itself, and by no means, as TREVIRANUS supposed, a prelimi- 
lary sport to excite the sexual passion : this is the copulation itself, 
vhich LISTER, DE GEER, LYONET, and others, described so fully 
jid so interestingly 1 . The danger of being cruelly put to death by 
he female spider causes the male to make his approaches to her 
vith anxious caution, and after the congress to betake himself 
apidly to flight. 

In the development of the arachnids from the egg, after the 
erminal vesicle has disappeared, there appear to occur, as in many 
ther animals, clefts and grooves in the yolk-mass. The ger- 
linal membrane or disc grows slowly round the yolk, closing 
nally on the dorsal surface. Before this closure is completed, 
e commencement of the embryo appears on the ventral surface of 
he yolk. Here are seen, at least in the embryo of the scorpions 
ccording to the observations of EATHKE, different thickenings 
ing in pairs near each other in a row, which are the beginnings 
the segments of the body. From the mucous layer of the ger- 
linal membrane arises the intestinal canal, which at first is not

separated from the yolk, afterwards lies between two lateral portions 
of the yolk, which, by transverse indentations, change into coccal 
sacs placed in pairs. These sacs, in connexion with the intestinal 
canal, are the rudiments of the biliary vessels and of the liver. The 
yolk changes into the liver, or the so-called adipose body. The 
limbs arise as conical appendages placed under the ventral surface, 
with the extremities turned downwards towards each other. On 
the dorsal surface of the yolk is seen a streak running longitudi- 
nally as the rudiment of the heart, that is at first without vessels. 
The nervous system, in its central parts, is formed at a still earlier 
period, and the cerebral ganglion is in the beginning proportionally 
much larger than it is afterwards 1 . 

We have already said that the scorpions are viviparous. With 
the egg-laying spiders, the egg, under the changes of development, 
slowly loses its previous form, and almost assumes that of a spider, 
indicating all the external parts of the inclosed animal. At length 
the shell bursts on the thorax, and the spider, first with the head, 
and afterwards with the thorax, comes to view ; then follows the 
abdomen, to which however the egg-membrane, like a scale, con- 
tinues attached for a time ; then come the feelers and feet 2 . The 
young spider, through whose integument the granules of the yolk 
may be clearly distinguished, is not yet in a state to weave a web 
and catch its prey ; for the spinning organs are still concealed be- 
neath the common integument. After the lapse of a week, or, in 
some species, a longer time, during which the spider takes no food, 
it casts its skin for the first time, and is, as it were, born for the 
second time. The young spiders now quit, on some mild clay in 
May or June, the web in which the mother had hidden her eggs ; 
they allow themselves to fall on the ground by a thread, and begin 
at once to weave their nets, or in some other way, according to the 
instinct of their kind, to watch for small insects corresponding to 
their age and powers.

ARACHNIDS. 567 

Most arachnids feed on other animals, which they either swal- 
;low alive, or whose blood and fluids they suck. Usually, after 
(their escape from the egg, they undergo no metamorphosis. They 
least, however, their skin more than once, and are commonly, after 
(the fourth or fifth moult, in a state for pairing. In most Acarina, 
|the young animals are at first supplied with only three pairs of feet, 
which gave occasion to some writers to adopt some six-footed 
qenera, which were afterwards rejected as unfounded. The Pycno- 
qonida and the genus Hydrachna present the most interesting 
changes of form, of which the most remarkable particulars will be 
noticed in the systematic arrangement of these animals. 

The power of reproduction in arachnids is commonly, as in the 
preceding class, considered to be small 1 . In many, however, lost 
feet can grow again. Thus G-EOFFROY once saw a Phalangium, in 
which one foot was less than the remaining seven 2 , and which pro- 
bably might have grown at a later period. At all events it is 
established that, in spiders, lost feet are regenerated 3 . In animals, 
.*vhose growth is limited, i.e. which do not grow after they are 
capable of propagating, I think the reproductive power, in this full- 
i^rown state, is small. In such a case are insects after their last 
, netamorphosis (see above, p. 276), but by no means spiders and 
Crustaceans. 

Very various is the form of the nervous system in the arachnids. 

I'n the greatest number there is a large ganglion in the thorax 

\ cephalothorax) , formed, as it seems, by the coalition of different 

t>ther ganglia, from which the nerves for the under-jaws and. palpi, 

,nd for the four pairs of feet, radiate. At the posterior margin of 

jhis ganglion arise, under acute angles, close to each other (as in 

I he cauda equina of mammals), the nervous trunks for the abdomen. 

Che two middlemost are sometimes thicker, lie closer together, and 

mite towards the extremity, before dividing, to form a ganglion

ery short) makes its appearance at the next moult.

(Telephonus} , or lying side by side form an abdominal cord with- 
out ganglia, as in the spiders. A chain of ganglia, as in most 
insects, is found in Tardigrada, in Pycnogonida 1 , and in Scorpio 
alone. In the Pycnogonida, the four ganglia, forming the row, lie 
close together, without connecting cords, just as SwAMMERDAM has 
figured the nervous system in Pediculus (see above, p. 301). In 
Scorpio, on the contrary, they lie, seven in number, at considerable 
distances apart, and are connected by two strings 2 . Above, and 
commonly close upon the thoracic ganglion, is placed a ganglion 
which may be considered as cerebral ganglion; in very simply 
organised arachnids it is seen as a simple commissure on the oeso- 
phagus ; in others it is oblong and formed of two small parts, 
mostly conical or pear-shaped, lying side by side. From it arise 
the nerves of the mandibles and of the eyes. Between this cerebral 
ganglion and the thoracic ganglion, there is always an opening, 
mostly very narrow, for the passage of the oesophagus, which is 
surrounded on each side by the nervous connexion of the two gan- 
glia. That the first ganglion is smaller than the second, and not 
broad, as in most insects, depends, without doubt, principally upon 
the absence of the compound eyes, whose nerves, in insects, have 
such a large development. Interesting also is the exceptional form 
of the nervous system in Phalangium, where the nerves proceeding 
from the thoracic ganglion form eight ganglia in their course, four on 
each side, not behind one another in a row, but at different heights, 
dispersed on each side of the body, and distant from each other 3 . 

Traces of a distinct nervous system for the intestines, of that 
system which we indicated above, in insects, as answering to the

ARACHNIDS. 569 

nervus sympatheticus (p. 278), are only imperfectly recognised. 
There has been found, in spiders and scorpions, a nerve that runs 
towards the stomach, and arises by two thin roots from the posterior 
margin of the cerebral ganglion 1 . 

The organs of sense in arachnids are limited, as far as they are 
known, to those of sight and feeling. A distinct organ of hearing 
has not yet been discovered. The seat of taste, probably also of 
smell, is to be sought for perhaps in the commencement of the intes- 
tinal canal. For feeling the palpi, in many at least, officiate ; in 
others, where, as in Scorpio and Chelifer, they are covered with a 
bard skin and are shaped like shears, they serve for seizing prey. 
The long feet also of spiders and of Phalangia, and especially the 
thread-like feet of the first pair in Phrynus, are peculiarly adapted 
for organs of feeling. The eyes are constantly simple. Behind the 
convex cornea is placed a very round lens, which is received by a 
vitreous humour concave on the anterior surface. Behind this 
tmmour lies the retina, surrounded by a coloured pigment of the 
choroidea, which at the fore part, between the lens and the vitreous 
humour, forms a ring like an iris. For the presence or absence and 
the number of simple eyes, we refer to the systematic arrangement 
of the class. Often, as in Scorpio, Phrynus and Tdyphonus, two 
simple eyes are placed close together in the middle, and on each 
side two groups of smaller simple eyes towards the margin of the 
cephalothorax. If this disposition be compared with that of insects, 
then the middle eyes may be likened to their simple eyes, and the 
two lateral groups to their two compound eyes. 

The muscles of the arachnids are principally inserted in the 
external integument. The cavity of the cephalothorax is especially 
occupied by a mass of muscle, because the limbs, which are moved 
by the muscles, are placed in a circle round about that part. In 
spiders there is found liere, for the attachment of the muscles, in 
addition, an internal oblong plate, tendinous, hollow above, and 
with the anterior margin excised. This part was already observed 
by LYONET 2 . It was also found by me in Phrynus, and in the

class of the Crustacea occurs largely developed in Limulus. The 
name of inner sternum has been given to it ; it occupies in some 
degree the place of the entotliorax in insects, .is not however a 
horny part penetrating inwards from the integument, but a pro- 
duction from the numerous interwoven tendons of the different 
muscles which mutually meet there 1 . 

Arachnids are met with in every quarter of the globe. I am 
acquainted with no families or principal groups (larger genera in the 
sense of LINNAEUS) which, as is the case in other classes, belong 
exclusively to the eastern or the western hemisphere. The larger 
arachnids inhabit warm regions, especially the genera Scorpio, 
Mygale, TelypJionus and Phrynus. By far the most of the animals 
of this class live on land, others in fresh water, in the sea only very 
few, just the reverse of what we remark in the crustaceans.

SYSTEMATIC 
ARRANGEMENT OF ARACHNIDS. 



CLASS IX. 
ARACHNOIDEA. 

ARTICULATE animals with articulate feet. Head and thorax 
conjoined to form a single part. Feet eight, placed at the sides of 
cephalothorax; abdominal feet none. Heart placed in the back, 
resembling an elongate vessel, in many giving off arteries. Respi- 
ration in some tracheal, in others pulmonal ; in some no distinct 
organs of respiration. Sexes mostly distinct. 

Section I. Tmetothoraca s. Apneusta. Cephalothorax divided 
into four segments. Stigmata none. Organs of respiration none. 
(Seat of respiration either in the external integument of body or in 
the digestive canal.) 

ORDER I. Polygonopoda. 

Feet elongate, of the length of body or longer than body. First 
.segment of body tubular, exsert, perforated at the apex by the 
mouth. Ocelli four in a tubercle behind the tube at the middle part 
rof the second segment. Abdomen small, conical. 

Family I. Pycnogonida (characters of the order). 

Sea-spiders. The genus Pycnogonum of BRUENNICH (Polygonopus 
PALLAS), with some other allied genera of later writers, forms a 
small group of marine animals, on the true place of which in the 
natural arrangement opinions differ ; for MILNE EDWARDS, and espe- 
cially QUATREFAGES and KROEYER, refer them to the crustaceans. 
That some of these animals live parasitically on whales and other 



572 CLASS ix. 

marine creatures appears to be a mistake 1 . They are dull animals 
living on the beach under stones, or on marine plants. They 
undergo, according to the observations of KROEYER, a remarkable 
metamorphosis, and have at first only two pairs of short feet, and a 
short, thick, undivided body. Afterwards a third pair of feet, still 
short, appears, and only in a succeeding state is the fourth pair added 
to them. 

That division of the body which lies in front of the first pair of 
feet and bears the eyes above, is in some more, in others less dis- 
tinctly distinguished from the first ring of the thorax. To this 
division are attached on the under surface two filiform parts, consist- 
ing of 7 11 joints, which in some species occur only in the female 
and serve for the attachment of the eggs. In some species in front of 
these are two pairs of other parts at the base of the conical sucker, 
of which the first pair, shorter and broader, mostly forms a shear- 
shaped nipper, the second is filiform, and consists of five, sometimes 
of more joints, and is commonly denoted as a feeler (palpus). It 
is worthy of remark that the first-named, the nippers or mandibulce, 
occur also in the earlier imperfect state of those species which, in 
the perfect form, are not provided with them. 

The hardness of the integument of these animals renders it less 
probable that they breathe by the skin. Probably they have an 
intestinal respiration, such as occurs also in other animals.

Here belong some small (microscopic) animals which live in 
mosses, in canals and sluices amongst confervse, and in rain-water in 
spouts. We alluded to them above (p. 206) in passing, and cited 
them when treating of the wheel-animalcule, with which they agree 
in the property of reviving after long apparent death.

ct, truncated, composed of two lateral parts (mandibles?), denti- 
ulate at the apex, and a middle part (labium) covered with nume- 
us recurved barbs. Feet with last joint armed with a caruncle

Ixodes LATE. 

Sp. Ixodes ricinus, Acarus ricinus L., DE GEER Mem. vii. PL 6, figs, i 8, 
LYONET Recherch. PL 6, figs, i 8, Tick, Louvette ; these animals live in 
woods, and attach themselves (the female) to different animals, especially 
to dogs ; from sucking the blood the body swells in form of a pea. The 
female is nearly 5'" long ; the male, much smaller, on copulating attaches 
itself beneath the abdomen of the female by means of the sucker, at the 
base of which the vasa deferentia open, to the vulva, situated at the fore- 
part of the body between the first and second pairs of feet. This singular 
copulation was already figured by DE GEER ; see also P. W. J. MUELLER 
in GERMAR u. ZINCKEN Magaz. der Entomol. n. 1817, s. 278 289. 
When laying her eggs, the female, according to the observations of FRISCH, 
gives out a clear fluid from her mouth, for fixing to her body the eggs, 
which the animal advances to her mouth ; hence the erroneous opinion of 
CHABRIER that the eggs are laid through the mouth.

xv. xvi. (probably Ixodes crenatus KOLLAR). This and other allied species 
known in America by the name of Piques are very distressing, and some- 
times dangerous to man and cattle. 

By the presence or absence of eyes (which are wanting in Ixodes ricinus), 
and some other characters, KOCH has divided this numerous genus into 
several others. See ERICHSON'S Archiv f. Naturgesch. 1844, s. 217 239,

This family unites some characters of the third family with others

Dermanyssus.

The distinction of these water-spiders as a peculiar genus is to be ascribed 
to O. F. MUELLER. LINNAEUS had not received these animals into his 
Systema naturce ; FABRICIUS in his Entomologia systematica, united the 
species then known to him with his genus Trombidium, and only after- 
wards, in his Systema antliatorum, made room for a distinct genus for these 
species under the name of Atax, p. 366. Besides the genus Hydrachna of 
MUELLER we also receive into this family a species of Acarus of LINN.EUS, 
which is the typus of the genus Limnockares of LATREILLE.

this and other species with six feet and a sucker, as MUELLER had already 
remarked (pullos ex ovis excludi sex tantum pedibus et prdboscide singulari 
instructos'), are described as distinct species of Acarida by AUDOUIN, under 
the generic name Achlysia (Mem. de la Soc. d'ffist. not. de Paris, I. 1823, 
pp. 98 109). DUGES has illustrated this subject by continuous observa- 
tions, and has made known the entire life of these water-spiders in its 
different periods, Ann. des Sc. not. 2e SeYie, I. pp. 165 171. From the 
eggs, which have been laid in spring in the stems of water-plants perforated 
for the purpose, little hexapod animals come to view, with a large heart- 
shaped sucker, which might be taken for a head, but that the eyes are 
situated behind it, on the anterior margin of the back. After an interval 
they attach themselves to different water-insects (Nepa, Ranatra, Dytiscus), 
and, whilst the abdomen is growing and extending itself into an elongated 
sac, the feet and the sucker remain of the same size. In this form the 
water-spiders were observed by SWAMMERDAM on Nepa (Bijbel der Natuur. 
PL in. figs. IV. and V.), and described by him as the eggs of this animal, 
although he had already expressed his doubts whether they were not rather 
distinct animals, which had their increase by sucking the blood of the Nepa 
(biz. 230). In this period the animalcules are named Achlysia by AUDOUIN; 
DUGES then calls them nymphs ; within the skin the perfect animal is 
formed, like a fly in the pupa coarctata (see above, p. 273). BURMEISTER 
also, simultaneously with DUGES, announced from his observations that 
Achtyiia is a youthful form of Hydrachna. OKEN'S his, 1834, s. 138 14 2 -

The young individuals of different species live parasitically on insects. 
These are the six-footed Acarida, of which LATREILLE formed the genus 
Astoma (Gen. Crust, et Ins. i. p. 162). On Phalangium also such hexapod 
parasites are met with (Genus Leptus LATR. 1. 1. p. 161). 

Stigmceus KOCH. With ocelli indistinct. 

Erythrceus LATR. (Rhymholophus DUGES, KOCH, Ery throws

Note. Body undivided. Four posterior feet not very remote from 
anterior. Other characters almost of Trombidium. 

On some other divisions see KOCH Uebersicht, ill. 2, pp. '41 60. Here 
also is to be referred genus Tetranchus DUFOUR (Ann. des Sc. not. xxv. 
1832, pp. i>]6- 283), to which division belong Trombidium telarium, T. 
tiliarum, T. Socium HERM., and other minute species of Acari, forming 
fine close webs that invest and suffocate shrubs and trees. 



ORDER IV. Phalaritjita. 

Cephalothorax conjoined with abdomen. Abdomen ringed or 
transversely folded. Palps filiform. 

Family X. Phalangita. (Characters of the order those of the 
single family). Mandibles didactylous, mostly exsert. Feet elon- 
gate, terminated by a single claw. 

Trogulus LATR. Cephalothorax produced anteriorly into a 
clypeus, covering the organs of the mouth. Ocelli two at the base 
of clypeus. Palps filiform, not unguiculate at the apex. Tarsi not 
elongate, with three joints. Body elongate, depressed.

Galeodes OLIV., LATE. (Solpuga LICHTENST., FABR.). Mandi- 
bles ventricose, large, porrect, with chelae vertical, the lower finger 
moveable. Palps with apex rounded, clawless, longer than the 
first pair of feet. First pair of feet unarmed, remaining feet 
armed with two claws at the apex. Ocelli two, placed in a 
common tubercle at the middle of the thoracic shield, near the

in ERICHSON'S Arch. f. NaturgescJi. vin. 1842, s. 350 356. Most of the 
species are from the old world ; there are, however, American species also 
enumerated by KOCH, to which may be added Galeodes limbata and G. 
Cubce, LUCAS in GUERIN Mag. de Zool. 1834, Arachn. PI. 5, 1835, Arachn. 
PI. II. These animals appear to reside in warm sandy regions, and to come 
from their lurking-places by night especially. On the dorsal surface of the 
upper -jaws some have a leaf-like appendage, which, according to GERVAIS, 
is a character of the male. 

According to J. MUELLER, besides the two larger eyes, there are in an 
Egyptian species two smaller eyes on pedicles, and two lateral eyes ( Vergl. 
Physiol. des Gesichtsinnes, s. 322) ; in the specimens investigated by me I 
could not perceive these eyes. 

The bite of Galeodes is considered to be very venomous and dangerous ; 
OLIVIER, who met with many of these animals in Persia and Arabia, was 
not himself bitten, nor was any one of his companions, by them, and was 
not able to discover any sure proof of the reality of the danger. Voyage 
dans V Empire otkoman, Paris, Tom. vi. 1807, p. 306. (Comp. also the

Scorpio L. (Characters of the family). Ocelli two in the 
middle of cephalothorax, approximate, larger. Lateral ocelli in

The scorpions live in warm regions of the temperate zone and in 
tropical countries. In the last joint of the abdomen is a poison- 
gland, which renders the wound of the scorpion dangerous, (see REDI 
De Generat. Insector. Amstelod. 1686, pp. 84 91 ; DE MAUPER- 
TUIS Experiences sur les Scorpions, Mem. de VAcad. de Paris, 
pour 1731, p. 223). Moreover these animals are distinguished by 
two comb-shaped appendages at the base of the abdomen. These 
appendages consist of a flat pedicle that runs transversely outwards 
and becomes thinner towards its apex ; this on its inferior margin 
bears parallel lancet-shaped leaflets (teeth), standing perpendicular 
to its axis. The number of these teeth differs in different species, 
yet is not sufficiently determinate but subject to change, so that it 
it is an uncertain character for the distinction of species.

ORDER VIII. Aramidea. 

Palps subfiliform, with last joint in males supplied with various 
appendages, subservient to copulation. Abdomen covered with 
skin continuous, mostly soft, constricted at the base or joined to 
the cephalothorax by means of a petiole. Stigmata never more 
than four, mostly only two. Respiration in all pulmonary, in some 
tracheal at the same time. 

Family XV. Araneidea (Aranece LATR.) Characters of the 
order also those of the single family. 

(Mandibles monodactylous, with terminal claw perforate, for the 
excretion of a poisonous liquid. Four or six papilloe cylindrical or 
conical at the inferior surface of abdomen, situated towards the 
posterior part, perforated by very minute foramina for the passage 
of a silky substance. Feet different in length, similar in form, 
terminated by a double or triple claw.) 

The spiders. All these animals prepare from a silky substance 
certain filaments with which they cover their eggs. Many, from 
the same substance, form also webs and nets in which they capture 
their prey. At the hind part of the body four, or in most species, 
six spinarets are found, beset with fine tubules through which the 
silky matter escapes. The secretion is effected in the form of an 
adhesive fluid by means of glands, or tubes of very different form, 
pear-shaped, glandular sacs united in groups, blind tubes convoluted 
and ramified. See TREVIRANUS Ueber den innern Bau der Arachnid.

The long threads that cover the fields or float in the air, especially 
in the fall of the year, (Gossamer, Herfstdraden, fils de la Vierge, 
Herbstgarn, der Jliegender Sommer) are considered by some writers 
to be products of the atmosphere, or exhalations from plants ; the 
chemical investigation of G. J. MULDER has proved that these 
threads agree in composition with silk, and beyond doubt are the 
work of spiders.

tubular web narrowed behind, in chinks of bark of trees, between stones, 
&c. ; the female places the web in which she has laid her eggs close to her 
nest. It has been asserted that these spiders are able to seize small birds 
(humming-birds), and hence the name of this species; there is, however, no 
reason to think that the account is founded on any thing better than fable.

cavities underground, closed by a circular cover as by a door, and lined 
internally with silken web. On the inside of the cover are small impres- 
sions, to which the spider attaches itself by means of the booklet of the 
jaws, holding fast to the walls of the tube with its feet, in order to keep the 
door close when an attempt is made to open it; this shuts down by its own 
weight. See SAUVAGES Mem. de I'Acad. des Sc. de Paris, 1758, Hist.

Anthrobia TELLK. Ocelli none.

Phalanx II. Aranece dipneumones. Spinarets six. (Pulmonary 
sacs only two ; stigmata mostly two, sometimes four, the two 
posterior leading to tracheae, not to lungs. Ocelli mostly eight, 
sometimes fewer. Claw of mandible capable of inflection trans- 
versely or laterally to the inner margin of mandible). 

Most of the spiders of this division have only two stigmata. In 
some, however, four are observed, and on that account the genera 
Dysdera and Filistata were placed by LATREILLE with Mygale 
(amongst the Tetrapneumones). But two of these stigmata do not 
lead to pulmonary sacs, but to air-tubes, and were also observed in 
Argynoreta by GRUBE. For the arrangement, therefore, this cha- 
racter of the number of stigmata is without weight, because it does 
not indicate natural affinity. The number of lung-sacs, on the other 
hand, appears to be in harmony with the characters derived from the 
mandibles and from the number of spinarets. 

A. Tubitelce. Spinarets cylindrical, parallel, collected into 
a fasciculus, directed backwards. Ocelli six or eight disposed 
in two rows (in one genus only two). Fourth or first pair of legs

CLASS X. 
CRUSTACEANS (CRUSTACEA) 1 . 

THE class of crustaceans is the last of articulate animals with 
articulate feet (see above, p. 248), all of which LINNAEUS regarded 
as insects. They breathe by means of gills, and there are no air- 
passages or stigmata present as in insects. They are distinguished 
from the preceding class by the presence of abdominal feet. The 
myriapods alone agree with the crustaceans in this respect, and arc 
by some writers enumerated amongst them, with which, however, 
on account of the presence of air-passages and air-tubes and of their 
resemblance to insect-larvae, they ought not in our opinion to be 
united. 

The name of the class is derived from the nature of their 
external covering ; this is in most cases hard, and contains a greater 
or smaller quantity of carbonate of lime. In other instances, how- 
ever, the integument is more leathery or horny. The tissue which 
supplies a foundation for the hard calcareous shell, is still the same 
cMtine which forms the dermal skeleton in the entire division 
of articulate animals with articulate feet (p. 284). The shell 
consists of different layers, with a layer of pigment beneath or 
equably penetrated by colouring matter. Between the rings

(segments) and in the joints alone is the integument thinner and 
more flexible. 

Let us first consider the external structure of these animals 
i little more closely. We have seen above that the body of insects, 
the myriapods excepted, is divided into head, trunk and abdomen. 
Such a division as this does not occur in the crustaceans. In many 
;he head is not distinct from the thorax, and its place is indicated 
solely by the position of the eyes, the attachment of the antennae 
md the presence of the mouth ; it is most completely connected 
jind, as it were, intimately fused with a large part of the body, in 
vhich the principal viscera are contained, and which may be corn- 
Dared not with the thorax alone of insects, but also with the an- 
;erior portion of their abdomen. To this part of the body another 
[succeeds, in which only the posterior portion of the intestinal canal 
ind of the nervous system is contained, and which is commonly 
;alled the tail; thus it is for instance in the cray-fishes. In 
pther instances the hindmost portion is less obviously separated 
|rom the trunk, and the entire body is parted into rings or segments. 
n the Xiphisoura the divisions or segments are not recognisable on 
he dorsal surface, for the body is parted into two shields alone, to 
vhich a long and pointed appendage is attached posteriorly. In 
thers the cephalothorax is more or less distinct from the rest of 
lie body, which is not obviously divided into segments but is 
overed by a bivalve, membranaceo-homy shell (Cypris}. In the 
wrripedia the partition into segments ceases ; the body ends with 
thin tail without appendage. They are surrounded by a mantle, 
n which, as in the class of the mollusca, calcareous plates are formed 
diich resemble the shells of these animals. 

To the anterior portion of the cephalothorax, or to the head 
tself, whenever it is distinct, the antenna, eyes and oral organs are 
Attached. When there are four antennas, as is the case with most, 
bey are placed either in the same plane, or the one pair is placed 
bove the other, so that according to their position they may be 
istinguished as middle and external, or as upper and lower. The 
xternal or lateral antennas are implanted close to the eyes, some- 
imes beneath the eyes. They consist commonly of three or four 
arger and thicker joints at the base, and a filiform part, terminating 
inely and composed of numerous joints. Sometimes the antennas 
erminate in two or three filaments of this kind. In some the 



600 CLASS X. 

antennae are short, in others very long ; the external are commonly 
the longest, and in the genus Palinurus exceed twice the length of 
the body. In some genera there are only two antenna? present; 
the genus Limulus has no antenna at all. 

There are commonly two compound eyes, or two groups of 
simple eyes. The simultaneous presence of two compound eyes 
with simple eyes, so common in the winged insects, is observed in 
only very few crustaceans. In most of these there are only two 
compound eyes, which are often fixed upon a pedicle and moveable. 

The mouth of crustaceans is situated on the inferior surface of 
the anterior portion of the body. The oral organs or jaws are 
arranged in pairs and move sideways, as in manducating insects. In 
some crustaceans, however, these parts acquire a modified form, and 
compose a sucker for taking up fluids, on which these animals live. 
The description of the jaws may well detain us some moments, and 
requires a more particular survey according to the different orders. 

In the ten-footed crustaceans (lobsters and crabs) a transverse 
upper lip is present ; beneath it lies a pair of upper jaws, which are 
very hard, cut off straight at the extremity, and at the upper margin 
provided with a short feeler of two or three joints. [Since the 
upper jaws (mandibulce) in insects are without feelers, it has been 
thought that these joints do not represent & palpus, but a continua- 
tion of the pedicle of the jaws : at all events this palpus differs from 
that which occurs on the accessory under-jaws of crustaceans.] 

A thin, membranous, bifid tongue, is situated at the base of the 
upper jaws 1 . To it there succeed a first pair of under-jaws, which 
are membranous, divided into lobes and beset with hairs at the 
margin. Next follows a second pair of under-jaws, which are also 
membranous and haired, and may be compared with the under-lip 
of insects which has been split into two parts. Then follow three 
pairs of jaws, or rather of feet changed into jaws, to be compared 
with the six feet of insects. At the outside of these accessory jaws 
a palpus is attached, which, as external division of the foot, does 
not correspond with the palpi of insects, and was named flagrum by 
SAVIGNY. This flagrum consists of a flat, elongated part at the 
basis, and a many-jointed filament running to a point at the end. 



1 COVIER calls this part sixi&me mdchoir, Lef. d'Anat. comp. in. p. 304 ; FABBI- 
CIUS gave it the name of lohiinn. 



CRUSTACEANS. 601 

The innermost part of the first pair of modified feet or accessory 
jaws is still fleshy and lobed, like the jaws that precede them ; but 
the auxiliary jaws of the second and especially of the third pair, 
indicate by their form that they correspond to feet, and bear small 
gills at their base. In the short-tailed ten-footed crustaceans the 
third pair has two very broad joints (the two joints of the femur, 
according to SAVIGN Y) , so that it covers the oral organs on its under 
urface. 

The auxiliary jaws of the two last pairs, which, as we have 
aid, indicate by their form even in the decapod crustaceans most 
lanifestly their true nature of feet, remain in many crustaceans, as 
n Gammarus and Squilla, unchanged feet. Hence these crustaceans 
ave fourteen unchanged feet, and not ten like lobsters and crabs. 

The genus Apus amongst the Entomostraca possesses those oral 
arts alone, which also occur in hexapod insects. To these succeed 
umerous feet, of which the first pair terminates in filaments con- 
isting of many joints, but contributes nothing to mastication. In 
jimulus there are six pairs of feet at the cephalothorax, without 
ny jaws ; the broad basal pieces, armed with spines, of the ten 
ast feet surround the mouth and perform the office of jaws, whilst 
he first pair of feet, scarcely a third of the length of the other feet, 
placed in front of the mouth. It forms two false jaws that may 
)e compared with the mandibulce of the Arachnoidea, whilst the 
oxa is membranous, and unites with that of the opposite side to 
orm a kind of upper-lip 1 . If we compare the second pair of feet 
vith the so-named under-jaws of Arachnids, we shall observe the 
p-eatest agreement between Limulus and them. Behind the last 
>air of feet also in Limulus there are even found two small 
ippendages, which may be compared with the pectinated organs of 
he scorpions. 

The body of crustaceans in the more restricted sense or the 
Tunk, the anterior portion of the abdomen, is almost always 
livided beneath by transverse indentations into sections, but its 
ipper part in the decapod crustaceans is covered by a continuous 
shield, named the shell (testa, in French carapace 2 ). In the short

tailed crustaceans the pectoral shield is much developed and covers 
the body beneath as the shell does above. The first sternal portion 
is very large and is situated in the mid line of the body. To it 
succeed four smaller sternal pieces, which are divided in the middle 
more or less obviously since they consist of the union of two lateral 
pieces. To the first piece the first pair of feet is attached, that of 
the so-called shears or claws ; to the four following the four follow- 
ing pairs are united. To the basal piece of the feet the lateral 
sternal pieces (episternalia) are attached, which lie on the outside of 
the middle pieces and fill up the truncated angles between them. The 
most posterior portion of the abdomen in the decapod crustaceans is 
always obviously divided into rings or segments, which are seven 
in number, or may be fewer from the fusion of some of the rings. 
The feet attached to these are short, commonly divided into two 
filaments ; the hindmost ring bears no feet. These last abdominal 
rings are usually called the tail. In the crabs they are very feebly 
developed, and the flat tail is curved round and lies with its 
extremity turned forwards in a groove in the middle of the pectoral 
shield. 

The intestinal canal of crustaceans is short and straight, and 
thus agrees with the nature of their food, which is animal. The 
anus is situated at the extremity of the abdomen or of the tail. In 
Limulus, however, the long styliform tail is not perforate, and the 
anus is situated on the inferior surface of the second shield, in 
front of the base of the tail. So is it also with the Cirripedia t 
where the jointless tube, improperly named proboscis by some, 
represents the tail, and where the intestinal canal opens at the base 
of this tubular prolongation. In some lower crustaceans the intesti- 
nal canal is nearly of the same width throughout its whole length, 
or has in the middle or more forward an expanded part, which may 
be considered as an imperfectly defined stomach 1 . In others an 
obviously distinct stomach is present, which is commonly armed 
with horny spines or with calcareous teeth. In Limulus the nar- 
row oesophagus with longitudinal folds goes straight forwards and 



and form of the internal organs that lie beneath may be determined. See A. 
BROGNTART and A. G. DESMAREST, Hist. not. des Crust, fossiles, pp. 73 79, and 
DESMAREST Cons. gin. s. 1. Crust, pp. 20 23. 

1 This is the case, for instance, in Asellus (Oniscus aquaticus L.), see TREViRANUi 
Verm. SrJir. I. s. 73, Tab. xi. fig. 64, &c. 



CRUSTACEANS. 603 

then curves into the stomach, which is placed almost perpendicu- 
larly. The stomach is compressed laterally, has thick muscular 
walls, and is armed internally with many oblong rows of horny 
spines. The pylorus projects conically into the intestine, which 
then proceeds horizontally backwards, lying in the first part of its 
course close upon the oesophagus that runs in the opposite direction, 
and lies below it 1 . In Squitta the stomach is small, muscular, 
triangular, armed in its posterior or pyloric portion with horny, 
pointed spines. In the ten-footed crustaceans the oesophagus mounts 
almost directly upwards. The stomach is capacious, and in its first 
part entirely membranous. The uppermost and hindmost or pyloric 
portion of the stomach is supported by hard parts, and therefore, 
even in the empty state, remains expanded. To these hard parts 
teeth are attached internally, by the assistance of which the food is 
comminuted. The epithelium of the stomach, moreover, is covered 
with numerous prolongations or colourless hairs, invisible to the 
naked eye, whose points are directed backwards 2 . To this stomach 
different muscles are attached, which arise on the inside of the 
cephalothorax, and which can also work upon the teeth described 
above. These muscles are, beyond doubt, subject to the will of 
the animal, and consequently we have here the rare example of an 
organ of vegetative life that is moved by muscles of animal life. 
fn some ten-footed crustaceans one or more blind appendages to 
the intestinal canal are observed, which probably are secreting 
organs 3 . There are some species in which two such blind tubes 
terminate in the intestine close to the inferior opening of the stomach, 
whilst a single third tube is attached to the intestine lower down. 
It is, however, this last unpaired tube which alone occurs in most. 
Unless this tube be regarded as an organ for the secretion of 
urine, no parts are known which correspond to the vasa urinaria of

2 At the hindmost part of the stomach, behind and under the above-mentioned 
teeth, these hairs may be distinguished even with the naked eye. The stomach of the 
cray-fish has been often described and figured. We content ourselves with referring to 
the latest investigations alone, those of F. OESTERLEN, in MUELLER'S Archiv, 1840, 
s. 387441, Taf. xii. 

3 See DUVERNOY in the second edition of CUVIER Le$. d'Anat. comp. v. pp. 228, 
229. In as far as they open close to the pylorus these blind appendages may perhaps 
be compared with the pancreas ; but ordinarily they are inserted further backwards. 



604 CLASS X. 

insects. In Oniscus and Porabea, according to TREVIRANUS, four 
short vessels, which open into the rectum close to its extremity, 
may perhaps correspond to the urinary vessels, or, as he supposes, 
to the biliary, although they differ from them greatly by their 
shortness 1 . As little are salivary organs known hitherto, except 
in the Cirripedia. The liver, on" the contrary, is commonly much 
developed here. In some lower crustaceans the intestinal canal is 
surrounded by a layer of small blind sacs (folliculi) or glandules, 
which may be regarded as a liver intimately connected with the 
intestine. In the Cirripedia the intestine below the stomach is 
surrounded by a liver formed of many blind sacs. In the Oniscides 
from two to six long blind liver-tubes are found, in most of the 
genera four, often with dilations like a string of beads, which are 
described by some writers as the adipose body of these animals. 
In Bopyrus the intestinal canal, according to RATHKE, receives 
seven liver-tubes on each side, which lie behind each other in the 
length, an arrangement which recalls that in the scorpions, whilst 
besides an unpaired liver-mass, incised into three parts, lies in front 
of the others on the stomach 2 . In Limulus there are two very wide 
gall-ducts on each side, at some distance behind the pylorus / they 
receive the blind convoluted tubes, of which the large liver-mass of 
this animal consists. In the decapod crustaceans only one gall- 
duct is found on each side, terminating in the intestinal canal, be- 
hind the lower orifice of the stomach. The liver is a double and 
symmetrical organ, as in most crustaceans, and each liver is divided 
more or less distinctly into three lobes ; in each of these lobes runs 
a tube, that terminates in the common gall-duct, and round about 
the tubes blind sacs (folliculi) are set, which unite as fingers do. 
These follicles consist of three membranes, of which the internal 
and external present no special structure ; the external is more con- 
sistent and more intimately connected with the middle membrane.

2 In Squilla the liver consists of lateral blind sacs divided into branches that 
extend throughout the whole intestinal canal, a disposition which agrees with that in 
Bopyrus, and may also be compared with that in Aphrodita (see above, p. 211). 
Above the liver, on the dorsal surface, lie the testes or ovaria, which also extend longi- 
tudinally, and consist of branched glandular lobes. The ovaria of Squilla were de- 
scribed by CUVIER as liver. See DUVERNOY Ann. <ks Sc. /., 2e Se'rie, Tom. vi.

CRUSTACEANS. 605 

The middle membrane is formed of a layer of nucleated cells and 
granular tissue, and of cells with fat-globules 1 . 

The blood-circulation, which was already more developed in 
the highest arachnids, is here seen to be more and more perfected. 
In all the heart is situated on the dorsal surface, and is arterial. 
In the Omscutes, the Stomapods, and Limulus the heart has the 
form of an elongated dorsal vessel, from which on both sides 
branches arise, that are distributed to the different parts. In the 
Lophyropoda the heart is more oval, and situated in the anterior 
part of the body on the dorsal surface. In the ten-footed crus- 
taceans (crays and crabs) the heart is roundish or hexagonal, much 
broader than the main trunks of the arteries, and is situated on the 
back between the third and fourth pairs of feet. The arteries in 
the crustaceans are very differently disposed; in some there seem 
to be only a few main trunks present, and the blood to flow else- 
where merely in the interspaces of the organs in determinate direc- 
tions, without being inclosed in vascular walls. In the ten-footed 
crustaceans, where these vessels are best known, an artery arises 
from the foremost part of the heart, in the middle, which is speci- 
ally destined for the eyes ; and, besides some smaller branches 
which it gives off, divides close to the eyes into two branches. 
Next to this artery, there is one on each side which is distributed to 
the antennae and neighbouring parts. More behind there arise, 
about the middle of the heart, on its under side, two arteries, one 
on each side, which run to the liver ; lastly, at the posterior ex- 
tremity of the heart, there arises a considerable single artery, 
which appears to fill the office of a posterior aorta, and gives off 
branches to the intestinal canal, to the generative organs, to the 
muscles of the abdomen, &c. AUDOUIN and MILNE EDWARDS 
name this vessel sternal artery (artere sternale). It presently di- 
vides into two main branches, of which one runs along the dorsal, 
the other the abdominal surface. 

The veins in crustaceans, even in the most perfect order of the 
Decapods, are represented by cells or spaces between the organs of 
the body, in which the blood is moved without proper walls.

These convey it into sinuses situated in the middle of the body 
or along the feet, and from which it flows to the gills. From the 
gills it returns to a sinus that surrounds the heart, and often in the 
ten-footed crustaceans is described as a pericardium. On the dorsal 
surface of the heart are fissures, which during the diastole of the 
organ afford an entrance to the arterial blood with which this sinus is 
distended 1 . The blood of crustaceans is whitish or purple, sometimes 
red, as in Apus. The velocity of the circulation is very different 
in different families of this class. CARUS, in the cray-fish, observed 
51 beats in a minute 2 , whilst in Daphnia 200 beats of the heart 
in a minute were remarked by JURINE and STRAUS DURCKHEIM S . 
The respiratory organs in the crustaceans consist of gills, which 
however are not met with in all, so that in some the skin itself 
appears to be the only organ of respiration. Also it is probable 
in a few that, at the same time that distinct gills are present, the 
skin is still partly serviceable for respiration, as in the lateral parts 
of the shield-like shell, in which the blood forms numerous currents, 
in Apus (according to ZADDACH) and in Argulus, in which last genus 
VOGT regards these parts as the sole seat of the respiratory func- 
tion. The gills have the form either of plates that, consisting of two 
membranes, are properly flat sacs, or of filaments. In the Cirri- 
pedia both forms are met with ; in Anatifa (and the other pediculated 
genera, Lepadicea) there are two or more pairs of soft conical fila- 
ments which, with the point turned upwards, are situated at the 
base of the pedicle of the cirri; whilst in the non-pediculated genera, 
the sea-acorns (Balanidea] , fringed plates at the inside of the mantle 
are present. In many other genera, especially in the Isopoda, the 
gills appear under the simple form of certain pairs of flattened sacs ; 
at the abdomen the feet are composed of two plates, of which the

external, of firmer structure and commonly beset with hairs at the, 
margin, protects as a gill-cover the innermost soft and sacciform 
slate, the proper gill. The normal number of gills is five pairs, but 
in the land Oniscides and Asellus there are only three pairs deve- 
.oped. In Asellus and many marine Oniscides, the gill-covers 
themselves contribute to respiration 1 . In most crustaceans indeed 
;hese two chief forms of plates or filaments become modified through 
greater development, and each gill consists not of a single plate or 
of a single thread, but of a large number of plates or threads. Thus 
.n I/imulus, on the upper surface of the five last abdominal feet, 
which have assumed the shape of flat semicircular discs, there are 
bund five pairs of gills, each of a hundred plates or more, whilst 
;he first pair of abdominal feet not bearing any gills at their base, 
t the external sexual organs, covers all the succeeding feet on the 
under-surface, after the manner of a gill-cover. In Squilla there are 
ive pairs of gills, in the form of numerous filaments placed pecti- 
nately on a pedicle, which are attached to the base of the fin-like 
posterior feet. In the ten-footed short-tailed crustaceans there are 
commonly seven gills on each side, of which that in the middle is 
the longest. They have a pyramidal form and are divided longi- 
tudinally by a middle septum from the base to the apex ; on this 
septum numerous plates are set at right angles which make up the 
Dyramidal body of the gills, and consist of folds of the double 
membrane of which the septum is composed; these plates thus 
form sacs which may be inflated through the septum. In some long- 
tailed decapods also the gills are leaf-shaped but in most they con- 
sist of a multitude of fine cylindrical filaments which are attached 
instead of plates to each side of the axis of the gill. The gills are 
more numerous, sometimes even twenty-one on each side. In all the 
decapod crustaceans the gills are situated under the lateral parts of 
the shell (carapace) in a proper cavity on each side, and are attached 
to the basal piece of the five pairs of feet, or at the same time to the 
tiindmost foot-jaws also. The water penetrates to the respiratory 
cavity by an opening on each side at the inferior margin ; in the 
short-tailed this opening is situated in front of the basal piece of

the first pair of feet ; in the long-tailed it is a fissure that extends 
along the entire thorax on each side. The water is expelled, on 
the other hand, along a furrow which opens forwards by the side of 
the mouth. In this canal an oval lamina is situated, which is the 
outermost lobe of the second pair of maxilla3, and produces by its 
motion a current forwards to force the water out 1 . 

In nearly all crustaceans the two sexes are distinct. In the 
Cirripedia, indeed, formerly counted amongst the Molluscs, the 
male and female sexual organs are united in the same individual 2 : 
[except in certain genera of the Lepadicea, as Ibla and Scalpellum 
LEACH, where there are not only, according to DARWIN, males and 
females distinct, but also the surprising fact of 'hermaphrodites 
whose masculine efficiency is aided by one or more complemental 
males 3 ,' often exceedingly minute, and rudimentary in structure, 
which are permanently attached to different parts of the female.] 
The ovary lies as an apparently granular mass in the pedicle of Ana- 
tifa, and under the microscope is seen to be composed of rounded 
lobes ; a tube which traverses the pedicle and opens into the mantle 
above by a fine aperture on the dorsal surface is the oviduct. In 
Balanus the ovary lies in the walls of the mantle. [According to 
DARWIN the female organs consist of true ovaria (salivary glands 
Guv.) seated on each side near the base of the labrum, of unbranched 
ovarian ducts and of ovarian branching tubes and coeca. In the 
Lepadicea the ovarian tubes branch out in all directions within the 
peduncle, and ova are developed in the footstalks of their branches 
as well as at their ends. Two unbranched tubes enter the body of 
the Cirripede from the peduncle and run into the two true ovaria 
situated at the base of the labrum and resting on the upper edge of

little or no resemblance to the juvenile form of Cirripedes, as we have been taught to 
know them by BDRMEISTEB. 

3 DARWIN Lepadidce, 1851, p. 182. DARWIN found the animals described by 
GOODSIR not to be males but females distended with ova. He considers them to be the 
females of the unnamed genus belonging to the family of loniens, described by GoOD- 
SIR, which live parasitically within the sac of the Balani. See DARWIN Monogr. of 
the Cirripedia, Balani da>. London, 1853, p. 271.

the stomach. These tubular glands are generally divided at the 

end near the mouth into a few blunt branches. Their precise 

connexion with the two main ducts has not been discovered. The 

state of these two masses varied much but since, at times, they 

contained aggregations of matter consisting of little balls closely 

resembling, in general appearance and size, the ovigerms with their 

germinal vesicles and spots, there could be no doubt that they are 

ovaria. DARWIN was unable to discover the orifice by which ST. 

ANGE supposes the ova to enter the sac. His observations lead 

Jiim to believe that the mode by which they enter the sac is quite 

; different : "Immediately before one of the periods of exuviation, 

the ova burst from the ovarian tubes in the peduncle and round the 

[pac, and, carried along the circulatory channels, are collected beneath 

I the chitine-tunic of the sac, in the corium, at this period remarkably 

[ spongy and full of cavities. The corium then forms, or rather, (as 

DARWIN believes,) resolves itself into a delicate membrane en velop- 

I ng each ovum and uniting them together in lamellae ; the corium, 

Laving thus far retreated, then forms under the lamellae the chitine- 

I;unic of the sac, and the last-formed one is immediately moulted 

vith the other integuments of the body. The membranes harden, 

he Iainella3 of ova become detached from the bottom of the sac, 

tnd are attached to the ovigerous frsena." In the Balanoidea the 

)ranching and inosculating ovarian coeca form a layer covering in 

>art the basis of the balanus, and in certain cases extending upwards 

>etween the two layers of corium round the walls of the shell 1 .] 

l?he testes lie on the sides of the body as small blind sacs that are 

ittached to branches that coalesce to form larger stems like veins. 

|)n each side there arises from the union of these branches a wide 

Ind tortuous canal (vas defer ens), which afterwards becoming nar- 

feower advances towards that of the opposite side; thus these two 

sltibes lie close together at the base of the caudiform appendage of the 

( ody, where they unite to form a ductus ejaculatorius, which opens at 

lie apex of the appendage 2 . In some lower crustaceans the females 

Ire much more numerous than the males, which are only imperfectly

or not at all known. In certain of them the males occur only at 
particular times of the year, and the females, like the leaf-lice, are 
fruitful without copulation through several successive generations, 
as in Daphnia and, according to JOLY, in Artemia. In others the 
males may, on account of their minuteness, have eluded observation, 
as in the parasitic genus Bopyrus, where they are surpassed in size 
by the female about four times. Besides the unequal size, the 
full-grown female in this and in other parasitic genera (Siphonos- 
tomes) often present a very deviating form. The sexual difference 
in the common form has not yet in the higher crustaceans been 
sufficiently investigated in the different families. In the different 
species of Limulus that difference is known pretty accurately. In 
the long-tailed ten-footed crustaceans the males have larger claws 
than the females, the last a broader abdomen than the first. 

As a rule the internal and external sexual organs are double. 
In Argulus there is only one ovary with one oviduct opening be- 
tween the two hindmost natatory feet, whilst however the external 
organs in the male are double 1 '. The ovaries are ordinarily two 
blind sacs, as for instance in the Isopods, elongate blind tubes. 
Only seldom are they divided into branches, as in Chondracanthus 
according to RATHKE, in Apus 2 and Limulus. They pass into two 
oviducts, which open each separately. In Limulus the two vulvce are 
near the first pair of abdominal feet, close to the basis at the dorsal 
surface. In the ten-footed crustaceans these two external openings 
are situated on the cephalothorax, between the feet of the third 
pair, or on the base of these feet themselves. Only seldom, as in 
Bopyrus, do the twa oviducts coalesce to form a single tube that 
opens into a single vulva. Sometimes there are yet accessory 
female organs, for the secretion of a covering of viscid fluid, either 
to cover the eggs, or to take up the sperma, as the two large bursce 
copulatrices in the short-tailed decapods 3 . The testes also have often

the form of two blind sacs. Sometimes, as in the decapods, these 
have a more glandular aspect, and consist of an aggregate of many 
follicles. In the long-tailed ten-footed crustaceans the two testes 
form a single three-lobed body, though there are two vasa deferentia. 
These efferent tubes open in these crustaceans, as also in the short- 
tailed or crabs, at the base of the feet of the fifth pair. In these 
mimals the external male organs of copulation have horny accessory 
>rgans attached to the first two abdominal rings which support the 
)enis in copulation, and which as to their function may be compared 
th the little bone that occurs in this part in some mammals. 

The eggs of crustaceans after they have been laid often continue 
tached to different parts of the parent's body, and there advance 
further development. In the Ontscides, and many other crusta- 
ans, the development takes place in a brooding cavity at the 
der surface of the anterior part of the body, where it is covered 

a different number, commonly by five pairs, of ventral plates 
.ng on one another like roof-tiles 1 . In DapJinia the eggs remain 

some time in a cavity beneath the shell on the back ; in Cyclops 
sy are carried about in two bunches by the female at the base of 
e abdomen. The same is observed in many parasitic crustaceans. 

others they are attached to the feet by an adhesive fluid hardened 
to threads; in the ten-footed crustaceans, to the feet of the abdo- 
3n or of the so-called tail. Other crustaceans divest themselves 

their eggs without bearing them about on their body, and attach 
em to other objects. Thus the female of Arguing foliaceus affixes 
r numerous eggs (100 200) by means of a viscid covering to 
mes 2 . Cypris also lays her eggs upon different bodies under 
iter, often in heaps of a hundred, which she covers with a green 
ready matter 3 . 

The egg of crustaceans, whilst still in the ovary, consists of the 
Ik, the germ vesicle, and the vitelline membrane. The yolk is 
ghtly fluid, and consists of shapeless fat-particles and cells, with 
ly a small quantity of albuminous fluid. The germ-vesicle, 
lich again includes different small vesicles (germ-spots), disappears 
ter impregnation, as soon as the egg enters the oviduct. Here, 011 
e other hand, it receives an external covering, a chorion, formed

from a coagulable fluid, which has been secreted by the oviduct. 
This covering is thicker than the vitelline membrane, and between 
the two only a small space or none at all remains ; in the first case 
a watery albuminous fluid occupies it. The production of the germ 
is, as in the egg of many other animals, both vertebrate and inver- 
tebrate, so also in that of many crustaceans, preceded by a parting 
and cleaving of the yolk *. There arise first in the yolk a greater 
or lesser number of membranous saccules, follicles which probably 
take their origin from the albuminous fluid portion of the yolk, 
and enclose a greater or lesser number of yolk-cells. The germ 
first appears as a nebulous grey spot, which consists of cells that 
have nuclei, and probably arise from modified yolk-cells. At first 
the germ is small, afterwards the germinal membrane grows round 
the whole of the yolk. It separates into two layers, which may 
be compared to the serous lamina and the mucous lamina in the 
blastoderma of vertebrates. Just as in insects and arachnids, the 
ventral parts of the walls of the body are the first that come into 
being. The parting of the body into rings or segments begins on 
the ventral surface. All the appendages (limbs, jaws, feet) greatly 
resemble one another at first, and on the whole the anterior mem- 
bers are formed first, the posterior last. Many crustaceans make 
their appearance from the egg with fewer limbs than they afterwards 
possess. But the development of crustaceans presents many dif- 
ferences, in the different orders, of which the particular description 
would demand too large a space. Such an uniformity of the plan 
of development, as we observe in the classes of vertebrate animals, 
seems in the lower classes of animals not to occur 2 . 



1 ERDL did not perceive the cleaving in the eggs of Astacus marinus, but did in 
those of Cancer mcenas. In this last EATHKE also observed the phenomenon, as well 
as in Gammarus fluviatilis and 0. Locusta, KOELLIKER in Ergasilus and Cyclops. 

3 As the comparative history of development in general, so especially has that of 
crustaceans, received its clearest illustration from the unwearied and distinguished 
investigations of H. RATHKE. We cite here his Untersuchungen uber die Bildung u. 
Entwickelung des Flusskrebses, mit 5 Kupfert. Leipzig. 1829, folio (from which ample

CRUSTACEANS. 613 

In very many crustaceans extremely remarkable metamorphoses 
have been observed, which, however, are confined to the first period 
of life ; long before they are full-grown, they have attained their 
permanent form, and after that only undergo repeated moultings. 
The young of Cyclops, already observed by LEEUWENHOECK and 
afterwards by DE G-EER, are so unlike in form to the parent animal 
that 0. F. MUELLER formed distinct genera of them, Nauplius and 
Amymone; flat, oval, without tail, with four or six feet very thick, 
and radiating from the body 1 . Young individuals of Ergasilus, 
AchthereSj Lernceacera, present similar forms with four or six feet, 
according to the observations of NORDMANN 2 . Also the Cirripedia 
present themselves at first under such a form as this, with which, 
however, that of the young of Apus agrees still nearer, that has no 
abdominal feet, and possesses two pairs of feet, of which the second 
extends behind the body. [But the larvae of cirripeds pass through 
three different stages. In the first the larva, whilst yet in the sac 
of the parent, is nearly globular, with lateral horns. Posteriorly, on 
the sternal surface, are two other minute horns pointing backwards. 
These horns are cases in which the antennas are being developed. 
There are three pairs of feet close together in a longitudinal direc- 
tion, some way apart in a transverse. The first pair has always a 
single ramus or filament, not articulate in some genera, multi- 
articulate in others. The abdomen, a little beyond the end of the 
carapace, terminates in a slightly upturned tail. The mouth is 
undergoing development on a prominence between the bases of the 
feet. Towards the second stage, the most conspicuous character is 
the great elongation of the posterior point of the carapace, whilst the 
abdomen is prolonged, and has two very long spear-like processes 
on its outside (Balanus GOODSIR) , or terminates in a single tapering 
spinose projection (Lepas THOMPSON). In the second stage, the 
body is prolonged behind the three pairs of limbs and ends in a 
blunt point, in which, probably, the three posterior pairs of feet, 
and the abdomen of the larva in the last stage, are developed. The

mouth is more forward, there are two simple eyes, and the smaller 
pair of antennae has disappeared. In the third stage, the larva is 
much compressed, nearly of the shape of a Cypris, and the thorax 
and limbs hidden and enclosed by the carapace elongated back- 
wards. The part of the head bearing the antennas is longer and 
larger than the rest of the body. The antennas are large and con- 
spicuous, consisting of three segments, of which the second (a 
sucking disc) is much the largest, the third very small. The 
antennas serve for walking, but their principal use is to attach the 
larva, the attachment being at first voluntary, but soon becoming 
permanent. There are now two large compound eyes close behind 
the base of the antennas. The mouth, as in mature cirripeds, is 
situated on a slight prominence in front of the thoracic limbs. It is 
within the carapace, and still rudimentary. The thorax consists of 
six segments with six pairs of feet, each with a pedicle bearing two 
arms of two joints. The abdomen is small, but with three seg- 
ments, of which the second is the longest, and bears two small 
appendages between which the anus is situated. The bivalve shell 
and compound eyes of the larva are first moulted: the antennae not 
at all. The young cirriped is closely packed within the larva, and 
there are two rudimentary eyes posterior to the cast-off eyes of the 
larva. They are situated beneath the integument on the upper 
part of the stomach 1 .] Scarcely less strange are the changes which 
most of the decapod crustaceans undergo. The early states of short- 
tailed crustaceans have been frequently recorded in systematic 
works as distinct genera. Thus the genus Zoe Bosc, with large 
eyes and a long bent beak and a recurved hook on the back, is 
founded merely on individuals in the first period of life of Cancer 
and Hyas z . These animals have then a long tail, which only at 
a later period is bent under towards the breast. But many long- 
tailed crustaceans also undergo changes of form, ex. gr. Pagurus. 
In Astacus marinus the feet are at first provided with a jointed fila- 
ment, which corresponds to the flagrum of the auxiliary jaws. Of 
all the decapod crustaceans hitherto investigated Astacus fluviatilis

jsents the smallest changes of form. The Amphipods, on the 
ler hand, come from the egg in a form similar to that of the 
rfect animal. Many Isopods, also, undergo only slight changes of 
form ; many acquire another pair of feet in addition to those which 
they had on leaving the egg. The young Limuli, according to 
MILNE EDWARDS, leave the egg without that ensiform appendage 
)r pointed tail which so strikingly distinguishes the full-grown 
ill. 

The crustaceans cast their shell several times. In younger indi- 
Luals these moultings succeed each other at shorter periods, but 
in full-grown animals, at least in the decapods, the hard calcareous 
shell is cast off only once a year. In the River-cray the moulting 
occurs towards the end of summer. The hard shell begins to 
loosen itself from the body, which in the meantime is replaced 
by a new covering situated beneath the former. The animal makes 
many movements and contortions, until at last a fissure occurs on 
the back between the abdomen and the large cephalothorax, from 
which the animal with the fore part of its body and its feet makes 
its appearance. At last the hinder part of the body divests itself 
of its old covering. For these observations we are indebted to 
REAUMUR. In the short-tailed crabs the shell splits on each side 
along the epimera. The cast-off shell presents perfectly the form of 
the living animal 1 . 

As long as the new shell is still thin and flexible, the crays and 
crabs are very sensitive. They then conceal themselves in holes, 
until the new shell has attained sufficient hardness, for which a few 
days only are requisite. 

With the shell the inner coat or the epithelium of the stomach 
is renewed in the crays and crabs. When a new internal tunic of 
the stomach has been formed the old one is cast off and dissolved in 
the cavity of the stomach. It has been supposed that the two 
round calcareous plates which are situated on each side of the 



contested the observations of THOMPSON, but afterwards admitted, with that upright- 
ness which always belongs to the inquirer after truth alone, his mistake respecting this 
important discovery, and that he had done the English naturalist a wrong ; Op. cit.

stomach, and are named crab's-eyes (oculi s. lapidcs cancrorum), 
supplied the matter from which the new shell acquired its hardness. 
These little stony substances are cast off with the old tumc of the 
stomach, and being freed from their capsules come into the cavity 
of the stomach, where they are broken up and partly dissolved. 
Thus it is possible that the calcareous matter, taken up into the 
blood, may be useful for the secretion of the hard shell (V. BAER). 
The part, however, which the crab's-eyes take in the secretion 
cannot be great, when we compare their weight with that of the 
calcareous matter in the shell. During the time that the shell is 
still increasing in hardness, no new crab's-eyes are produced ; but 
only after the shell has attained its greatest hardness is calcareous 
matter again secreted on the walls of the stomach, and new crab's- 
eyes again appear. Thus the production of crab's-eyes would appear 
to be a vicarious secretion ; a secretion of such constituents of the 
blood as, if too abundant, would be injurious to the organism, like 
the secretion of urine for instance, but with this difference, that the 
calcareous matter is not set at liberty shortly after its secretion, but 
remains accumulated for a long time in continuance 1 . 

The power of restoration or reproduction is very great in this 
class, so that even feet, amputated or broken off, are replaced by 
new ones. 

We will now speak concisely concerning the organs of animal 
life. The nervous system consists, as in articulate animals generally, 
of a cerebral ganglion above or in front of the oesophagus and of a 
ventral cord, which is formed of a greater or lesser number of ganglia 
connected together by two filaments. Originally every nervous 
ganglion consists here, just as we remarked formerly on the ringed 
worms, of two lateral portions. In some crustaceans this separation 
of the nervous ganglia persists even in the adult state, as in Gyamus, 
Talitrus and Idotea ; the lateral parts are merely connected by a 
transverse commissure. In the Oniscides the two nervous filaments 
of the cord lie quite apart from each other, and the ganglia still 
indicate evidently, by their compressed broad form, their original

opinion respecting the use of the secretion of crab's-eyes, I. bl. 410. Comp. on thin

mdition of pairs. The number of the ganglia is, however, very 
Ferent, and varies from more than sixty in opus to two in the 
short-tailed ten-footed crustaceans. In cancer mcenas a cephalic 
ganglion is situated above or in front of the oesophagus ; from it arise 
the nerves of the eyes and of the antennas and neighbouring parts. 
From the posterior part of this ganglion proceed the two nervous 
filaments, which form the oesophageal ring, send in the middle 
a nerve to the upper-jaws, and afterwards unite in the middle of 
the thorax in a ganglion that is excavated in the centre. This 
annular ganglion is almost eight times larger than the cephalic 
ganglion in front of the oesophagus ; from its circumference nerves 
arise that run to the feet and other parts, and, in addition, a single 
nerve from the back part, that runs in the middle throughout the 
tail and takes the place of the continuation of the ventral cord, but 
has no ganglia 1 . In this crab, consequently, the ganglia of the 
thorax and of the anterior part of the abdomen are represented by 
a single ganglion, which, however, by the excavation in the middle 
affords an indication of the lateral divisions. In the genus Maya, on 
the other hand, the union has attained the highest degree, and the 
large thoracic ganglion has lost the excavation in the middle. 
Here then there are only two ganglia present, one for the head and 
one for the thorax and rest of the body 2 . In the long-tailed ten- 
footed crustaceans, on the contrary, there are different distinct 
nervous ganglia in the ventral cord, twelve, for example, in the

Crustaces, Ann. des Sc. nat. xiv. 1828, pp. 76 102, PI. 2 6. 

A fuller description of the nervous system in different families of the Crustacea 
would extend beyond the limits of this Handbook. I will here only add, that in 
Limulus the cephalic and thoracic ganglia coalesce to form a thick elongated nervous 
ring, which behind the oesophagus is connected by three transverse commissures, and 
from which backwards a nervous cord arises composed of two closely connected nervous 
bundles, which in the ventral shield presents inconspicuous gangliform thickenings, and 
afterwards divides into two lateral portions ; each of these strings then terminates in 
an elongated semilunar ganglion, at the inferior extremity of which two nerves arise 
that penetrate the caudiform appendage. On the part of the cephalothoracic ring lying 
in front of the oesophagus there are two conical swellings forwards, from which the 
two very long optic nerves arise for the two compound eyes situated above on the 
dorsal shield. These nerves go first forwards and upwards, then bend outwards, and 
afterwards go backwards to end at the inside of the eyes. Their length is more than, 
one quarter of that of the whole animal, the tail included.

lobster. In the hermit-crab (Pagurus) there are, besides the cephalic 
ganglion, only six ganglia, but the form of the nervous system is 
in other respects the same 1 . 

The nervous system existing especially for the organic life, 
which we have already noticed in insects and spiders, is not want- 
ing in the crustaceans also, however it still in many families 
remains for the most part or entirely unknown. It has been 
especially investigated by BRANDT in some Decapods, Stomapods 
and Oniscides. In crays and in Squilla it consists of a single 
portion and two lateral portions. The single portion arises at the 
posterior margin of the cerebral ganglion, and has no nervous 
ganglion that lies in front of the brain as in insects ; the lateral 
portions arise from the oesophageal band that connects the cerebral 
ganglion with the succeeding ganglionic cord. Distinct ganglia are 
not present at the origin of the lateral portions, but appear to 
be fused with the oesophageal band, which indicates a swelling at 
the point of origin of these lateral nerves. The system of nerves 
spreads itself over the stomach, presents here one or two ganglia, 
and finally divides into two branches which are distributed to the 
liver. In Porcellio BRANDT found no single portion of this system, 
but only two small lateral swellings, situated behind the cerebral 
ganglion and connected to it by two thin filaments, which send fine 
branches backwards to the stomach 2 . 

In most crustaceans, common feeling on account of the hardness 
of the covering cannot be otherwise than very small. The antennae, 
which are often much developed and four in number, are wanting 
only in few, and, like the whiskers in mammals, may serve for a fine 
sense of touch even in the dark. In like manner, probably, the 
jointed filaments of the cirripedia, and the filaments on the foot- 
jaws of the decapods and other appendages of the body, may serve 
for touch in many species. A special organ for taste is not known, 
but the seat of this sense appears to be in the commencement of the 
ossophagus 3 .

cerebral ganglion.

cited above (p. 279). 

3 According to MILNE EDWARDS, who appeals to his observations made with 



CRUSTACEANS. 619 

In the river- and sea-crays KOSENTHAL first described and 
figured an organ as that of smell, which afterwards was also found 
in some other decapods, but is wanting in most species of this order, 
as well as in the remaining crustaceans. At the base of the middle 
or innermost antennas he found a triangular opening beset with 
hairs, which is the entrance of a triangular cavity lined with a soft 
membrane, in which nervous branches are distributed 1 . 

Just as little is known of the organ of hearing in most animals 
of this class. In the ten-footed crustaceans it was discovered by 
J. C. FABRICT US, and MINASI and SCARPA, and others, after him, 
described and figured it in the river-cray (common cray-fish). At 
the base of the outermost antennae is a very hard wart-like ex- 
crescence, at whose point is a round opening covered by a tense and 
very elastic membrane. Behind this membrane is a vesicle filled 
with fluid, on the walls of which a nerve is distributed that arises 
with the nerve of the external antennae from the cerebral ganglion 2 . 

The compound eyes in crustaceans are formed on the same plan 
as in insects. BLAINVILLE found in them the vitreous humour, as 
did JOH. MUELLER after him in the eyes of insects ; and his descrip- 
tion of the eyes of Palinurus agrees with that which we have given 
above of the compound eyes of insects 3 . In many crustaceans, for 
instance in the crays, the facettes of the cornea are not hexangular, 
as in insects, but quadrangular ; in some other ten-footed crustaceans,

much developed in crustaceans. Hist, not des Crust. I. pp. 112, 113.

in the Stomapods, &c., they are, however, hexangular. In Limulus 
they are also hexangular, not very regular, and at the outside but 
little raised. In some crustaceans the eyes are covered with an 
undivided smooth cornea, as in Apus; they are compound eyes 
with a cornea without facettes 1 . They make as it were the tran- 
sition to the clustered eyes, placed in two groups at the side of the 
head of the Isopods, as Oniscus, Idotea, &c. 

The passive organs of motion of crustaceans are the hard cover- 
ings of the body and of the limbs, the dermal skeleton. There are 
also frequently productions of this covering penetrating inwards, 
horny or hard calcareous projections to which the muscles are 
attached. In Limulus an elongated, rectangular tendinous plate, 
somewhat excavated on the upper surface, is situated in the inside 
of the cephalothorax, just as in spiders, in which, at the fore part, 
are two cylindrical processes that pass into tendons. This part is 
moved by many muscles, and, with its movements, those of the feet 
are also connected. The legs of decapods have at every joint a 
flexor and extensor muscle; those of the first pair or of the so-called 
claws, in accordance with the greater strength of this pair of limbs, 
are the most developed. The muscles of the tail in the crays 
(lobsters, cray-fish, &c.) are divided into two layers; the layer 
which is situated on the ventral surface, that of the flexor muscles, 
is more composite and more powerfully developed than the layer 
which lies towards the back 2 . 

In art-instincts the crustaceans appear to stand below most 
insects and arachnids. In them the vegetative or organic life is 
more developed than the animal. 

The geographic distribution of crustaceans has not been hitherto 
sufficiently investigated, although LATREILLE, and after him espe-

separate divisions of the eye are either attached immediately to the cornea or have 
lenses placed before them, which lie under the cornea. See on these peculiarities 
MUELLER Handbuch der Physiologic, II. s. 309. The eyes of Limulus do not however 
belong to the division in which MUELLER places them. The organs of vision in Crus- 
taceans are largely treated of in E. WAGNER Lehrb. der vergl. Anat., 2te Auflage,

cially MILNE EDWARDS, have made copious contributions to it, 
which however are confined principally to the order of the decapods. 
With the different peculiarities that have an influence on the distri- 
bution of species we are not yet satisfactorily acquainted. The 
difference of salt-particles in the different seas comes here beyond 
doubt into consideration, arid not the mean temperature alone ; the 
relative depth also, the nature of the coasts, &c. On the whole, 
the general rule, that animal forms, the genera and species, are 
more numerous in proportion as we advance from the poles to the 
equator, has not such an unlimited prevalence for marine animals. 
In size also and in brilliancy of colour the animals of the polar seas 
often contest the palm with those of the tropics. Yet the short- tailed 
ten-footed crustaceans, so rich in species in the seas of the warm 
regions of our globe, are almost entirely wanting in the neighbour- 
hood of the poles. On the other hand, the northern regions are 
rich in forms of amphipods, which necessitate the adoption of 
many distinct genera ; so that the colder seas may be regarded as 
the proper home, the true father-land of these Crustacea 1 .

SYSTEMATIC 
ARRANGEMENT OF CRUSTACEA, 



CLASS X. 
CRUSTACEA. 

ARTICULATE animals apterous, supplied with articulate feet 
both thoracic and abdominal, breathing mostly by branchiae, some- 
times by the skin, without stigmata. Heart very often distinct, 
aortic, situated in the back. 

Sexes in most distinct. Animals mostly aquatic. 

ORDER I. Pmcilopoda. 

Jaws none. Feet of cephalothorax placed round the mouth, 
with coxae very spinose, performing the office of jaws. Abdominal 
feet resembling semi-orbicular lamellae, bearing the branchiae. Two 
shields, gibbous above, hollowed beneath, horny, hard, one covering 
the cephalothorax, the other the abdomen. 

Family I. Xiphosura. (Characters of the order.) Twelve 
pairs of feet, six attached to the cephalothorax, six to the abdomen. 
An appendage elongate, acuminate, carinate or gibbous above, 
plane beneath, adhering by articulation to the posterior part of the 
abdominal shield, covered by very hard skin. 

Limulus MUELL. (Polyphemus LAM.). 

This genus contains only few species, and is the only one in this 
family. The anterior shield is round forwards, and terminates on 
each side behind in a point, which extends along the outside of the 
second shield, which is of less breadth, about as far as its middle. 
This second or abdominal shield has an irregular hexangular form, 
and is armed on each side with seven sharp teeth and six moveable 



CRUSTACEA. 623 

awl-shaped spines between them. The feet of the CephalotJiorax 
have a shear-shaped extremity ; in the sixth pair the shear is small 
and almost concealed by four lancet-formed, horny laminae, that 
are provided on the outside with a projecting ridge. Below on the 
abdominal shield are six pairs of leaf- shaped natatory feet, of which 
the first pair is the largest, and almost entirely covers the rest on 
the inferior surface ; the five following bear on their dorsal surface 
the gills, which consist of many plates. 

Above, on the shield of the Cephalothorax, are situated two 
kidney-shaped compound eyes, very remote from each other, and 
more forward and near the middle, close to each other, two very 
small simple eyes of an oval form.

sold in pairs. In the months of July and August they are daily taken in 
quantities near the roads of Batavia, and brought alive to market. The 
Malays eat the eggs with avidity, and the flesh also is agreeable to them 
and to the Chinese. These animals can live more than a day out of water ; 
when laid on the back they are not able to right themselves. The tail is 
a powerful instrument of defence.

I think it is only a monstrous variety of Limulus moluccanus. Several 
fossil species are known from the lithographic formation ; see my monograph,

ORDER II. Ichthyophthira. 

Mouth suctorial. Rostrum tubular, including two mandibles 
setaceous, acuminate, formed of labium and labrum conjoined, 
sometimes concealed, or a tubercle instead of haustellum. Anterior 
feet supplied with hooks or acetabula for fixing the body. Animal- 
cules, in the adult state, adhering parasitically to fishes, often 
deformed, soft, with segments obsolete. Females supplied with 
oviferous appendages (external ovaries). 

Fish-lice. We prefer this name to that of Parasita, introduced 
by WIEGMANN, because in the class of insects an order of Parasitica 
had been previously adopted. The animals when young swim 
freely about, by means of feet with long hairs, and resemble the 
young animals of Cyclops.

There was much doubt formerly respecting the place of these gill-worms 
in the natural arrangement of the animal kingdom. CUVIEE placed them 
amongst the intestinal worms (intestinaux cavitaires, see R. Ani. ie e*dit. 
ill. p. 255), as a distinct and anomalous family. The resemblance to some 
other parasites, which had been referred to the Crustacea, caused indeed a 



CRUSTACEA. 625 

suspicion that the Lerncea also might belong to this class (DESMAREST 
Cons. gn. s. la Classe des Crust, p. 344), but it was only after the observa- 
tions of NORDMANN on the young form of Lernceocera cyprinacea, L. esocina 
BURM. (Mikrogr. Beitr. n. Tab. vi. figs. 5, 6), that the matter could be 
regarded as definitively settled. The young animal has three pairs of feet 
and a single eye in the middle at the anterior part of the body.

CRUSTACEA. 627 

We have already noticed this genus (p. 575). It was regarded by LOVN, 
who has treated of its structure most exactly, as a form of transition 
between the Trematodes and the ringed worms. I think that the short 
jointed feet militate against this disposal of it. The surface beset with 
vibratile cilia would seem to remove it from the crustaceans, with which 
however it has the most affinity. The characters which LOVEN gives to 
the genus are: Corpus molle, depressuin, discoldeum; proboscis retractilis 
mutica; anus discretus ori oppositusj bothria later alia opposita; pedesinferi, 
articulati, hamiferi; genilalia mascula duplicia mutica. There are different 
known species of these animalcules, living parasitically on Comatulce, only 
one or two lines in size, of which one is distinguished by conical cirri, twenty 
in number, at the margin of the disc of the body. See LEUCKAKT Zoolo-

Family IV. Ergasilina. Ceplialothorax large. Abdomen arti- 
culate, made up of many segments. Two or four antennas. Mostly 
four pairs of abdominal feet (natatory). 

In these parasites the similarity of form with the genus Cyclops 
is very conspicuous, so that even AUDOUIN and MILNE EDWARDS at 
first placed the genus Nicoikoe, discovered by them, with the Mono- 
culina.

Natatory feet mostly eight, cloven into two oars. 

This family is very closely allied to Caligus, Ergasilus, and some 
other genera of the preceding order, from which it is distinguished 
by the absence of the suctorial beak, and especially by the longer 
antennae.

The two large jointed appendages, especially useful in swimming, 
which we have here regarded as posterior antennse, are by many

London, 1851, and Monograph of the Cirripedia (Balanidce, Verrucidce, 
&c.), London, 1854. 

With LINNJEUS these animals formed only a single genus (Lepas). 
LAMAECK was the first who made of them a distinct class, to which, on 
account of the filiform arms, he gave the name of Cirrhipedes (cirri- 
pedes*). Most writers place them amongst the molluscs, although 
the resemblance to articulate animals was apparent to many, and 
CUVIER shewed himself not averse to the opinion that they ought 
perhaps to be arranged amongst these. The history of their develop- 
ment, however, illustrated by J. Y. THOMPSON 2 and BURMEISTER, can 
leave no reasonable doubt that the cirripedes belong to the articulate 
animals, and amongst them do not form a distinct class, but only an 
order of the crustaceans. The place alone, which we allot them in 
the series of the crustaceans, may perhaps admit of some doubt, but 
we think that it ought to be preferred to a position at the end of 
the crustaceans, which determines nothing respecting their true 
affinity. According to us the Cirripedia have the same relation to 
the Daphnidea and Phyllopoda as the Lernceacea to the Copepoda. 

Although the shells differ much in different species, and some of 
these animals are pedunculated, others not, yet the cirripeds have 
such an agreement in internal and external structure, that we have 
every reason to admire the sagacity of LINNAEUS who united them 
all in a single genus. 

The body of these animals is in the adult state inarticulate, 
although on the dorsal surface, between the different pairs of feet,

a separation into segments is indicated. It terminates backwards in 
a thin tail, which earlier writers improperly called the proboscis. 
Along the ventral surface there are six pairs of arms, each of which 
bears on a short pedicle two long filaments turned inwards, that 
consist of numerous joints and are beset with hairs. The animals 
extend these filaments constantly during life, from the opening of 
the shell and draw them into it again, by which they introduce 
within the shell the water for respiration and with it their nutri- 
ment. 

The nervous system consists of a row of six ganglia, or properly 
pairs of ganglia, connected by two nervous cords. The first ganglion 
is situated on the short oesophagus ; on each side a nervous string 
descends a ring being thus formed round the oesophagus to the 
second ganglion, which is situated between the first pair of feet. The 
intestinal canal is straight and very short ; it runs along the dorsal 
surface and terminates at the base of the tail. Through this tail 
runs the common efferent tube of the two vasa deferentia and opens 
at its point. These animals are bisexual, with some exceptions (see 
p. 608). 

[The prehensile antennae of the larvae of Cirripeds in the last form 
contain the ducts of the cement glands, which may be traced from 
within the discs of the antennae to the anterior or lower ends of the 
incipient ovaria. The gland which secretes the cement appears to 
be a part of an ovarian tube specially modified. If the base of at- 
tachment of a Cirriped be carefully removed, the larval prehensile 
antennae, from which the cement always escapes, will be found very 
near to its extremity. In sessile Cirripeds a new cement gland is 
formed at every period of growth. DARWIN Lepadidce, 28, 33 '.] 

Cirripeds are found in the seas of every region of the world ; they 
attach themselves to rocks, to many marine animals as shell-fish, 
turtles, whales, to different polyparies, to marine plants, to the hulls 
of ships, to the floating wreck of vessels that have been lost, as frag- 
ments of wood, bottles, &c.

3d the larvae of Anatifa, without however recognising their true nature. See 
latuurk. Verlust. Tab. vill. fig. -2, which almost entirely agrees with the figure of

Sea- Acorns, SearTulips. The pieces of shell, that form the calca- 
reous tube, shut upon each other with teeth. In some the base is 
closed by a calcareous plate, in* which hollow tubes run from the 
middle to the margin, which communicate with other tubes in the

[To obviate the extreme confusion of the nomenclature, DARWIN 
proposes the following names for the external parts of Balanoids. 

What is visible externally of sessile cirripeds is composed of 
shell and operculum, the operculum being generally seated a little 
within the orifice of the shell. The shell consists of basis or support 
by which it is attached (membranous or shelly), and of compart- 
ments (8 4) occasionally all calcified together. The compartment 
as the end of the shell where the cirri are exserted is called carina, 
that opposite to it rostrum, those on the sides are the three lateral 
compartments, that next the carina the carino-lateral, that next the 
rostrum rostro-lateral, and the middle one simply the lateral com- 
partment. These three are rarely present together. Each com- 
partment consists of a wall (paries) which always grows downwards 
and forms the basal margin, and is furnished on the two sides with 
alee or with radii, or with an ala on one side and a radius on the 
other. The radii, not always developed, on the upper part over- 
lap the alee, which usually extend about half-way down the 
compartment. The carina has always two alee. The carino- 
lateral and lateral compartments have always an ala on the rostral 
side and a radius on the carinal. The rostro-lateral (when present) 
always radii on both sides. The rostrum normally has alee on 
both sides, but very often, when fused with the rostro-lateral com- 
partments, it has radii on both sides. The operculum consists of a 
pair of scuta and a pair of terga, joined to the sheath of the shell by 
the opercular membrane. On the internal surface of the scutum 
there is almost always a pit for the attachment of the Adductor scu- 
torum muscle, and beneath the adductor ridge, often a pit for the 
depressor later alw muscle. 



CRUSTACEA. 637 

A slit-like orifice between the opercular valves leads into the 
sac in which the body is lodged. The valves are two on each side, 
tergum and scutum. The tergum has three margins, the scutal, basal, 
and carinal / on the basal margin a spur (calcar) depends. The 
scutum has also three margins, the basal, tergal, and occludent, so 
called from opening and shutting against the opposite valve. DARWIN

638 CLASS x. 

Family X. Lepadicea (BLAINV.) s. Anatiferce. Animal sus- 
pended by a peduncle cylindrical, flexible. Shell mostly com- 
pressed or involucrum coriaceous. (Genus Anatifa BRUG.)": 

[These Cirripeds consist of a capitulum, much flattened, and a 
pedicle of various length. The capitulum is generally formed of 
five or more valves, connected together by narrow or broad stripes 
of membrane : sometimes the valves are rudimental or absent, when 
the whole consists of membrane. Of the valves the scuta are the 
most persistent, then the terga, then the carina, the rostrum and 
latera occur only in a few (Pollicipes). The scuta and terga are 
always considerably larger than the other valves. Within the 
capitulum is the sac which encloses the animal's body. The pedun- 
cle is usually flattened, sometimes quite cylindrical. Its corium is 
very thick, and in those genera having numerous valves, scales are 
found at its connexion with the capitulum placed in whorls. The 
peduncle is lined by three layers of muscles, running from its bottom 
to the base of the capitulum : and the cement ducts may be traced 
upon them on each side until they expand into the two cement 
glands, and which are connected with the ovarian tubes. The 
cement escapes through the larval prehensile antennae, which may 
be always found quite close to the end of the peduncle if it be 
carefully removed from the surface of attachment. Yid. DARWIN 
Lepadidce, pp. 28 37. See also above, pp. 608, 609.] 

Tetralasmis Cuv., Ibla GRAY. Peduncle short, hirsute. Shell

angular.

Anatifa LAM. (Species from genus Anatifa BRUG.). Peduncle 
smooth, resembling intestine, elongate in some. Shell with five 
valves; the single dorsal valve narrow, falciform. 

Goose-mussel. The four pieces of shell in pairs are, as in the preceding 
genus, to be compared with the opercular plates of the Balani ; the single 
piece of shell along the back of the animal carina corresponds to the calca- 
reous tube, and the stem is as it were an elongation of the basal piece of 
the tube of the last-named animals.

Britain, C. DARWIN'S Monograph, 1851, printed for the Palseontographical 
Society. 

[From the investigations of DARWIN, recorded in his two admir- 
able memoirs so often cited, we learn that his subclass of Cir- 
ripeds contains forms that differ greatly from those of the JBala- 
noidea and Lepadicea and are much less perfect in their organisation. 
He divides the Cirripeds into three orders the Thoracica, Abdomi- 
nalia, and Apodes, the limbs or cirri being thoracic in the first, 
abdominal in the second, and entirely absent in the third. In the 



640 CLASS X. 

Thoracica three families are included the Balanidce or sessile Cirri- 
peds, the Verrucidce, (the genus Clysia LEACH, Creusia LAM., Ver- 
ruca SCHUMACHER, SCHUM. Essai oTun nouveau Systeme des Habita- 
tions des Vers testaces, 1817. Copenhav.), remarkable for their 
quite asymmetrical shell, and the Lepadidce or pedunculated Cir- 
ripeds. In the second order of Abdominalia the seventh or last 
cephalic segment is quite distinct, and bears rudimentary organs 
answering to the first pair of foot-jaws in ordinary crustaceans, 
of which organs, and of the segments supporting them, there is 
no trace in the Thoracica; the seven succeeding thoracic seg- 
ments are destitute of any appendages ; but the three segments 
of the abdomen bear three pairs of cirri. In the metamorphosis 
all the first changes are merely indicated by changes of form 
in the egg-like larva, without the development of distinct organs, 
and the last or pupal condition, which is attained within the sac of 
the parent, is very peculiar from the entire absence of rotatory 
limbs. There is only one genus Cryptophialus DARWIN, and one 
known species Cryp. minutus DARW., Balanidce, p. 566, Tab. 23, 
24. The third order Apoda is the most peculiar of all, it resembles 
the larva or maggot of a fly, the carapace is reduced to two separate 
threads for attachment. The last cephalic, the seven thoracic, and 
the three abdominal segments are all destitute of appendages. The 
single known species, Proteolepas bivincta, is parasitic within the sac 
of Alepas cornuta, DARWIN Lepadidce, p. 165, Tab. 3, fig. 6. See 
DARWIN Balanidce, pp. 20 22.] 

ORDER V. -Cladocera LATE. 

Body compressed, included in a horny shell, divided into two 
parts by a dorsal fold, without hinge. Head free, produced below, 
terminating in a species of rostrum. Two small antennas at the 
apex and two larger at the base of head, split into two or three 
branches. Feet foliaceous, with four or five pairs. Abdomen ter- 
minated posteriorly by two setaceous appendages. 

Family XI. Daphnidea STRAUS. The characters of the order 
are those of the single family. Single compound eye. Larger 
antennae ramose, serving like oars for swimming. Ova in females 
situated on the back in a space between the shell and the segments 
of the thorax. 

Polyphemus MUELL., Cephaloculus LAM. Eye single, large, 
occupying almost the whole head. Larger antennas bifid. Feet 
eight, exsert from shell. Tail reflected, bisetose at the apex.

These animals resemble in some degree the larva of the common ephemera, 
so that LINNJEUS himself was in doubt whether Cancer stagnalis was not 
such a larva. They live in stagnant fresh water, and in pools formed by 
summer-showers in roads. The young animals do not at first resemble the 
old ones, have a short oval body, and besides the antennas, two pairs of 
jointed appendages, of which the first pair consists of two long and strongly 
developed rowing feet, curved, bent backward, and beset with many hairs ; 
these parts afterwards change into the posterior antennae or horns of the 
head ; the abdomen lengthens, and only after repeated moultmgs acquires 
feet, which at first are less numerous because the posterior appear later than 
the anterior.

These animals, on a first impression, seem to have some conformity with 
the genus Limulus, although they are much smaller. They differ however 
from these greatly, as well in their oral organs, which are formed on the 
type of insects (compare SAVIGNY Mem. sur les Ani. s. v. I. pp. 63, 64, 
PI. VII.) as in internal structure. They undergo, as already stated in 
p. 613, a metamorphosis resembling that of Branchipus. They are found 
in fresh water, canals, fish-ponds, and pools formed by abundant rain.

Appendix to the PHYLLOPODA. 
Trilobites or Palceades. 

Fossil crustaceans. Shield cephalic, rounded anteriorly, mostly 
supplied with two lateral eyes oval or reniform, often extending j 
posteriorly on each side into a horned point. Segments of thorax j 
and abdomen transverse, different in number, mostly divided by 
two longitudinal furrows into three convex lobes. The posterior 
part of abdomen often undivided (pygidium). Body of some con- 
tractile into a ball. 

Very different opinions were entertained formerly respecting the 
Trilobites. Because the transverse segments in these fossil indi- 
viduals offered some resemblance to Chiton, LATREILLE was really oi 
opinion that they ought to be placed in the neighbourhood of this . 
genus. Mem. du Museum, VIL pp. 22 32, Regne Ani. 2e edit. iv. 
pp. 202, 203, whilst he had previously considered them to be a j 
transitional form between the Crustacea and the myriapoda, between 
Limulus and Glomeris (R. Ani. lere e"dit. in. pp. 150, 151). That 
these remains belong to the type of the articulates was already 
apparent to LINNAEUS, who collected the few petrifactions of this 
division known to him under the name of Entomolithus paradoxes. 
WAHLENBERG in 1818 (Act. Societ. Reg. Scient. Ups. Yol. vin. p. 1), 
in a memoir in which new species were also described, illustrated 



CRUSTACEA. 645 

and confirmed this opinion of LINNAEUS. He thought that the 
Trilobites had the closest affinity with Limulus. This opinion was 
also adopted by some other writers, although to me the affinity with 
Limulus appears certainly not to be greater, or even not so great, 
as with Branchipus or Apus. The Trilobites were probably gigan- 
tic Phyllopoda which peopled the seas of a former world. The re- 
semblance to the Isopoda appears to me to be rather an analogy 
than a real affinity. That the Trilobites were possessed of small 
natatory feet which were soft, and so lost in the petrifying, is very 
probable 1 . They are all confined to the oldest mountain-strata, in 
which petrifactions occur, which preceded the coal-formation, and 
are found especially in the Silurian formation of MURCHISON and 
other modern geologists.

published by him and DESMAEEST, Hist, natur. des Crustaces fossiles, Paris,

Other Trilobites were able to roll themselves up, like Glomeris and 
some Oniscides, and to bring the shield of the tail to that of the 
head. They had, as it seems, a harder shell, and commonly a 
larger tail-shield. To these belong : 



1 It was principally because these feet are not known that LATREILLE arrived at 
she singular opinion concerning the agreement with Chiton; he says of his own accord, 
-hat under this point of view he must consider the eyes, which are observed in many 
["rilobites, to be tubercles.

lateral at least setaceous. Eyes two, sessile, in most composed of 
a cluster of ocelli, in others compound. 

Family XIV. Epicarides or Bopyrina. Antennas very short, 
imperfect, resembling tentacles. Feet short, incurved, hooked. 
Parasitic animalcules ; females much larger than males, broad, with 
eyes none or indistinct. 

Bopyrus LATR. Five pairs of abdominal feet lamellose, con- 
cealed under abdomen.

physiologicce du<z. Cum tab. iii ceneis. Rigse et Dorpati, 1737, 4to. 

The species hitherto known of this and the following genus live parasiti- 
cally on Palcemones (Carides), in the gill-cavfty or on the ventral surface of 
these crustaceans (Bopyrus abdominalis KROEYER on Hippolyte). The sexual 
difference is in these animals when adult very great. The male is elongate, 
narrow, and keeps himself hidden between the gill-plates of the female. 
The female is much larger, broader and asymmetrical. There are seven 
pairs of short feet attached to the trunk, and five pairs of gill-leaves (abdo- 
minal feet) on the abdomen, which is divided into six rings, of which the 
hindmost is very small, and bears no gills. The young animals of each 
sex are on the contrary of similar form, with four pairs of feet and long 
posterior antennae (RATHKE, Zur Morphologic, Reisebemerkunycn aw 
Taurien, s. 47 51).

These Isopods may be named Land-Asselli, for although some of 
them keep to the sea-shore, they do not live in water. The most 
live under stones, bark of trees, in chinks of walls, &c. They gnaw 
various substances. At night especially they seek their food, which 
consists principally of vegetable matters. 

A. Oniscinea. -Basal joint of the last pair of abdominal feet 
short, not produced beyond the last segment of abdomen. Antennae 
geniculate, with from six to nine joints (the five basal joints thicker, 
the terminal seta with one or two, three or four joints). 

Tylos LATE. External antennas moderate, with nine joints, the 
four terminal joints forming a short seta. Last pair of abdominal 
feet lamellose, concealed under abdomen. Body contractile into a

seven distinct segments, bearing seven pairs of feet not cloven into 
two oars. Membranous vesicles for respiration adhering to the base 
of some of the feet. 

We unite here, after the idea of KROEYER, the Lcemodipoda of 
LATREILLE with the order of the Amphipods ; see KROEYER Tids- 
skrift, iv. 1843, pp. 490495. 

Section I. Lcemodipoda. Posterior part of abdomen or tail 
short. First segment of trunk conjoined with head, an oblique 
furrow alone on each side indicating the separation; feet of this 
segment inserted forwards, beneath the head. Two or three pairs 
of branchial vesicles in the anterior part of trunk. 

Lcemodipoda from ACUJUOS and Smous; these animals were thus 
named because they have two feet under the head, as though at the 
throat. They do not swim, but creep on marine plants and animals 
in search of food. The posterior part of the body is little developed. 
In most the feet are wanting in those rings that carry gill- vesicles, 
and conversely the gill-vesicles are wanting on those rings that have 
feet. 

Family XXI. Lcemodipoda. (Characters of the section). 

Phalanx I. Gyamea. Body oval, mostly much depressed, with

Gammarus pulex FABR., GERV. is very common in ponds. The fema 
carries her eggs under the body at the base of the feet, until the youn 
emerge. RCESEL saw the animals nibbling at roots, fruits, and other par 
of plants which he gave them. Usually, however, they live on anim; 
food, and according to DE GEER, do not spare even the bodies of the 
companions. They attain a length of about 2". The hinder end of ti 
body is always bent downwards. Compare also on this species J. (

he also confounded Orchestia with it appears, however, from his citation of BASTBB.

Most of the species come from the Indian and African seas ; yet one 
species from the Mediterranean is known. These animals gave occasion to 
the name of the family which does not apply to the following genus. 

Amphion EDW. Shell elongate, oblong, continuous, covering 
head and all the segments of trunk. Tail narrow, conical, com- 
posed of seven segments, terminated by a flabelliform pinna. Ex- 
ternal antennae long, furnished with an oval scale at the base, 
filiform.

Family XXVI. Caridididea or Schizopoda. Shell covering 
head and trunk, descending to the sides over the bases of feet, com- 
pressed. Abdomen long, made up of seven segments, the seventh 
with two lamellae of the last abdominal feet on each side composing 
a flabelliform pinna. Feet of trunk slender, natatory. 

This family forms by its habitus the transition to the following, 
from which, however, it differs by the absence of shear-shaped feet 
and by the gills not being included within the shell.

Family of uncertain position. Cumacea KROEYER. 

Cuma EDW. 

Compare EDWARDS Ann. des Sc. nat. xin. 1828, pp. 294 296. 
EDWARDS, at a later period (Hist. nat. des Crust, in. p. 553) announced 
the opinion that this genus has no foundation, and that the little animal 



664 CLASS x. 

observed by him might really be the larva of some decapod. KEOEYER 
(Tidsskr. in. 1841, pp. 503534) has refuted this, having found other 
species of this form, and females with eggs in a sac beneath the abdomen. 
Cuma is thus an adult animal. It has no eyes, almost the form of a 
long-tailed decapod, but five thoracic rings are not covered by the shell. 
The superior antennae are short, the inferior in the female very short and 
rudimentary, in the male long. The feet have no shears. These animals 
resemble the Caridina, but perhaps better still might they be referred to 
the stomapods. GOODSIR and KROETER have adopted some new genera 
in this small family: Leucon KROEYER, Bodotria GOODSIR and Alauna 
GOODSIR, which last genus, however, KROEYER characterizes differently. 
See hereon TidssJcrift, Ny Raekke, n. 1846, pp. 123 211. 

ORDEE X. Decapoda. 

Two compound eyes, placed on a petiole moveable, biarticulate. 
Antennae four. Carapace large, covering head, thorax and anterior 
abdomen. Branchiae adhering to the base of the posterior maxilli- 
form feet and of the feet of trunk, pyramidal, covered by the sides 
of the shield. Mostly three pairs of maxilliform feet, in a few only 
two pairs. Feet of trunk not changed, almost always in five pairs, 
in some six. Mandibles almost always furnished with a palp. 

Most crustaceans of this order have a very hard covering, and to it, 
with the exception of the Limuli, the largest species belong : but 
there are many small ones also. It is the most numerous and the 
most important to man on account of the quantity of edible species. 

Section I. Macroura. Post-abdomen large, often longer than 
cephalothorax. Penultimate segment with lateral appendages form- 
ing with the last segment a terminal pinna of the tail, mostly 
flabelliform. 

Antennae long, the middle exsert, terminated by two or three 
setaceous filaments. Vulvae situated in the first joint of the third 
pair of feet. 

The third pair of foot-jaws are elongate, whilst on the contrary 
they are broad in the following division and cover the oral apparatus. 
The caudal feet are mostly more developed than in the following 
division, and serve for swimming. The shell is not so thick as in 
the Brachyura and at the same time less hard. 

Family XXVII. Caridina. Middle antennae inserted mostly 
above the lateral, more rarely in the same horizontal plane as lateral.

of these crays are renowned as delicacies. Amongst the exotic species, 
there are many of which the internal antennae have two long filaments, as

IN what precedes we have treated of the greater part of those 
animals that have no internal skeleton or no vertebrae. There still 
remain however for our consideration many that, in the system of 
Linnceus, were referred to the class of worms, but which by CUVIER 
were, first as a class, afterwards as a larger group constituting a 
primary form (typus), collected together and separated from the rest 
of the worms 2 . Since they do in reality form such a group, which

may be compared with that of the vertebrate animals, to which four 
classes belong, it is not inexpedient, before we pass to the consi- 
deration of the different classes which have here, with more or less 
propriety, been adopted, to indicate the common characters which 
distinguish the molluscs from the rest of the worms. 

The body of these animals is covered by a skin, soft and con- 
stantly moist, to which the muscles are attached, and in which or on 
which a calcareous secretion is usually effected. The external in- 
tegument, which indeed has also been named mantle (although 
properly a free production on the dorsal surface ought alone to bear 
that name), encloses as well the intestines as the nervous system 
also. The central parts of this nervous system consist of ganglia, 
which either form a ring round the oesophagus or lie more dis- 
persedly, but not behind each other in a row on the abdominal sur- 
face, as is the case in the insects. The molluscs ordinarily present a 
much less similarity of the right and left half of the body than the 
articulate animals already reviewed by us, or the vertebral animals 
to be considered in the sequel. Many have no head distinct from 
the rest of the body. The organs of sense are on the whole slightly 
developed. In the most composite molluscs however, in the Sepics 
and other Cephalopods, there are found not only two highly de- 
veloped eyes, but also rudiments of auditory organs. The move- 
ments are on the whole creeping and slow. Some, that live in 
water, are immoveably attached to different objects. Many headless 
bivalve molluscs have indeed a springing motion, yet this is in a far 
less degree successive than in articulate animals. 

The inferior degree of development of the organs of animal life 
is the cause that many writers of the present day, as LINN^US 
formerly, still place the molluscs lower than the insects in the 
arrangement of the animal kingdom. 

More perfect than the organs of animal life are those of the vege- 
tative, those for secretion, nutrition, and propagation. The respi- 
ratory organs are usually gills. In most molluscs a heart is 
present, which receives the arterial blood from the organs of respi- 
ration, and distributes it by arterial tubes to the different parts of 



affinites des animaux auxquels on a donn le nom de Vers. From this memoir read in 
1795 before the >Sbc. d'Hist. nat. of Paris, it appears that even thus early the class of 
the molluscs was distinguished by CUVIER and defined as in his later works. 



682 ON MOLLUSCS 

the body. Capillaries are wanting, and the veins are replaced by 
sinuses, which have no proper Avails, but are excavated in the 
different parts of the body. The blood of molluscs is commonly 
white or whitish blue. Some molluscs are bisexual, and require 
mutual impregnation; in others the sexes are distinct. The most 
are oviparous. The eggs are surrounded by a thin shell (Chorwn), 
between which and the yolk in some an albuminous fluid is inter- 
posed, and which is sometimes horny, and but seldom covered with 
calcareous incrustation. Often the eggs, when laid, are connected in 
bunches, or adhere to each other by a gelatinous mass. The num- 
ber of species that live on land is small in comparison of the much 
greater quantity of species that live in fresh, and especially in salt 
water. 

Before we proceed to the division of the molluscs, we would 
treat shortly of the shells which cover the body in most. The uni- 
valve shells are called cochlea, the bivalve, as those of mussels, 
conchce. There are also some molluscs that are covered by many 
pieces of shell. Such a multivalve shell (testa multivalvis) has the 
genus Chiton, where transverse calcareous plates, lying behind one 
another in a row, cover the back. The bivalve shells are thicker 
at the part where they are connected with each other. This part is 
named the point (apex}. At the point there are on the margin, within 
the shell, usually projections and hollows, which mutually fit into 
each other, and to which the name of hinge (car do) is given. When 
this margin is smooth, there is said to be no hinge (testa acardis). 
In front of the point a slight depression is seen on the shell, which 
is named the male depression (lunula, by LINNAEUS anus) ; behind 
the point is a chink, ordinarily smaller and more elongate, the fissure 
(fissura, in French ecusson, with LiNN^US vulva). On this the liga- 
ment is usually situated which, formed of elastic horny fibres, runs 
transversely from one shell to the other. Where this ligament, as in 
most of the bivalve molluscs, is attached to the outside of the shells, 
it is obvious that they will be opened by its contraction. Yet 
even where the ligament is placed internally the two shells are 
separated from each other by its elasticity, because in this case the 
fibres are forcibly compressed by the shell when closed. In those 
bivalve molluscs which move freely, the opening of the shell is 
turned downwards, the point upwards, and the ligament backwards. 
LINNAEUS, in his description, placed the bivalve shell with its point 



IN GENERAL. 683 

downwards, and turned the ligament forwards. BLAINVILLE, on 
the contrary, described it in the position which we have indicated 1 . 

In the univalves (cochlea, testae univalves, subbivalves) the fol- 
lowing parts may usually be distinguished. The extremity of the 
spire is called the point (apex), which, when the animal is alive and 
in motion, is turned upwards and backwards. Ordinarily the cavity 
of the shell terminates in a point at this part, but it is sometimes 
truncated horizontally (apex decollatus s. truncatus), which must not 
be mistaken for an accidental fracture which always leaves an open- 
ing. In some univalve shells (as in the genus Patella), the cavity 
between the point and the aperture is neither twisted to the right or 
left, nor forwards or backwards. In most, on the other hand, this 
cavity is turned. Usually all the turns run obliquely from above 
downwards (turbinated shells, cochlea turbinata et turrita)', yet in 
some the wreaths or turns run from left to right in a transverse 
direction, whereby the last wreath includes the rest externally (testa 
convoluta s. involuta, the involute shell, as in the genera Conus and 
Oliva), whilst others again are turned in one and the same vertical 
plane, from behind forwards and from above downwards (cochlea 
revoluta, as in the genus Nautilus). 

The opening (apertura) of the shell is opposite to the point. 
That part of the cavity, which is visible within the mouth, is called 
the throat (faux). The mouth may be excised with a sinus ante- 
riorly (apertura emarainata). Whenever it terminates forwards in 
a channel (apertura canalifera), then the tube is called the tail 
(cauda s. rostrum}. At the mouth the external margin (labium 
exterius s. labrum] is distinguished from the internal margin (labium 
internum s. margo columellaris) . The spindle (columella) is that 
part which runs in the middle of the shell directly from the point to 
the aperture, and round which, as an axis, the wreaths are turned. 
Such a calcareous axis is not present in all univalve shells; to see 
this part distinctly, a shell sawn longitudinally must be provided. 
At the internal margin of the aperture there is often on the ex- 
tremity of the spindle, especially in the shells of younger molluscs, a 
cavity which is called navel (umbilicus). Shells, in which this aper- 
ture is wanting, are named imperforate (cochlece imperforatce). 



1 That which with LiNN^iUS is the right and the left shell still preserves thia 
name, since he turned the bivalve not only upside down, but also the fore part 
backwards. 



684 ON MOLLUSCS 

The internal cavity of the shell may extend uninterruptedly 
through all the turns (cochlea monothalamia s. unilocularis] , or may 
be divided by several partitions (cochlea polythalamia] . A cylindri- 
cal tube traversing these partitions is named siphon (sipho}. Such 
a many-chambered shell is that of the genus Nautilus. 

Cover (operculum) is the name given to a round calcareous or 
sometimes horny lamina, which in many molluscs is attached to 
the uppermost and hindmost part of the so-named foot, and which, 
when the animal retracts itself within the shell, closes the aperture. 
Sometimes a spiral line is seen on this part, as for instance in 
the genus Turbo. Some writers name the shell, in this case, testa 
subbivalvis. 

Finally, according to the direction of the wreaths, univalve 
shells are distinguished as right- and left-turned. In most of them, 
when placed on the aperture with the point backwards, the external 
margin of this is on the right side, and the turns run from the point 
to the aperture from the left side to the right (cochlea dextra}. If 
the converse takes place and the external margin of the aperture 
lies on the left, then the turns run from the right to the left side 
(cochlea sinistra s. contraria), and with this a displacement of the 
internal organs is connected. Some species of molluscs have such a 
left-handed shell as the rule, and in others (as in Helix] shells of 
this sort occur as varieties or deviations, just as a displacement of 
the internal organs, of the heart at the right-side, &c. has been also 
observed occasionally in man 1 . 

What has been stated may suffice for the explanation of the 
most common and necessary terms 2 . But for the general anatomy 
and physiology it is desirable to contemplate shells in another 
point of view, and to investigate the mode of their origin and 
composition. 

The formation of shells is effected by the external integument 



1 On such left-turned snail-shells CHEMNITZ has published various remarks and 
observations in the Journal Der Naturforscher VIII. s. 163 178, XII. s. 76 84. 
That from the left-handed variety of Helix Pomatia right-handed young are again 
produced, was observed by him with perfect certainty ; ibid. xvii. s. i n.

or mantle of molluscs. REAUMUR l has illustrated the formation by 
his experiments. He found, on boring the shells of living snails, the 
aperture to become closed again by a thin layer occupying the whole 
of it, to which other layers were afterwards added. Thus there was 
no calcareous matter secreted at the edge of the aperture by vessels 
running in the shell, as in the reparation of bones where the forma- 
tion of new osseous matter proceeds from the extremities of the 
fractured bones. When, however, REAUMUR supposes that the forma- 
tion of shells is a mechanical transudation, that the secretion of lime 
on the upper surface of the mollusc may be compared to calcareous 
incrustations, which in certain waters and springs are formed round 
bodies immersed in them, that the skin of the animal, like a sieve, 
permits an adhesive fluid loaded with calcareous particles to escape, 
and that this fluid by evaporation and rest loses its watery particles, 
then his representation bears too forcibly the character of off-hand 
ideas respecting living beings, and POLI is so far justified in calling 
the origin of shells an organic origin, and in rejecting this mechani- 
cal explanation. It is clear that shells by the addition of new 
laminse become thicker. In a shell several layers or calcareous 
scales lie upon each other, which in bivalves originate from the 
point; hence the shell is, at this part, of greatest thickness, and 
becomes gradually thinner towards the margin. Thus every shell 
consists, as it were, of many others, all of which becoming larger 
and larger, lie under each other, whilst the innermost, the last 
formed, extends beyond the others at the margin. In oyster-shells 
and many other bivalves this may be clearly seen, and snail-shells 
also indicate the same; in younger univalves the number of turns is 
fewer; the larger shells of the same species present a greater num- 
ber of wreaths than the smaller, without however those wreaths, 
that were already present in the young ones, increasing in size. So 
also the spines, tubercles, and other excrescences of univalves are 
at first short and obtuse, and become larger and more acute by the 
addition of new layers. The increase however is not at all times 
uniform, but in the cold of winter and the great drought of summer

is suspended. Hence stronger stripes arise, which indicate succes- 
sion in growth, and are the traces left of it. 

As to chemical composition, besides some other less constant 
constituents and a small quantity of phosphate of lime, univalve 
and bivalve shells consist principally of carbonate of lime and an 
animal substance, a membranous substratum, that remains after the 
calcareous matter has been dissolved by acid, and is usually very 
small in quantity compared with the calcareous matter. POLI, 
when he exposed the membrane to the fire, saw it quickly take 
flame, on which he perceived a smell like that of burning horn; a 
spongy carbon remained. 

This conducts us to a correct view of the nature of shells, 
which belong to the same tissue as horn, hair, and in part also 
scales, i.e. to horny tissue. In most animals the dermal skeleton 
(such is the name given to the hard parts placed externally, to 
which the muscles are attached,) is horny, whilst, on the other 
hand, cartilage is almost always the foundation of an internal 
skeleton, especially of a true neural skeleton. The microscopic 
structure of bivalve and univalve shells has been chiefly illustrated 
by the investigations of CARPENTER. In some bivalves the entire 
substance of the shell consists of layers of membrane, without 
visible cells, in others such a membranous tissue forms the inside of 
the shell, whilst on the outside columnar, often hexagonal cells are 
visible under the microscope, which to the naked eye, or with the 
use of a lens, look like fibres. They stand nearly at right angles 
on the surface of the shell from within outwards, and are filled 
with carbonate of lime. In each layer they are at that part only 
which projects beyond the edge of the preceding layer; thus they 
have been secreted by the edge of the mantle, whilst the whole 
mantle, in every new formation of a layer, produces a membrane 
that covers the inner surface of the entire shell. The univalve 
shells of the gasteropodous molluscs have only a small quantity of 
organic substance; in many three layers of plates may be distin- 
guished; the direction of these plates is different, and those of the 
middle layer intersect those of the external and internal at right 
angles. Every plate consists of a row of long columns, or pris- 
matic cells, which are arranged side by side 1 . 



1 See W. B. CARPENTER Annals of Nat. History, Vol. xii. 1843, PP- 377 39' 
PI. XIII. XIV. and especially his later, more general investigations, announced in 



IN GENERAL. 687 

In many, especially bivalve shells, a horny, brown-yellow 
outermost covering is found, which has been named epidermis or 
recently periostracum also (in French Drop marin}. Sometimes it 
is hairy or divided into scales, which however are more apparent at 
the margin of the shell, having been worn off from the parts pre- 
viously formed. This membrane has been regarded as a continua- 
tion of the cuticle of the mantle, by which this is connected with 
the margin of the shell. More correctly, perhaps, this covering may 
be explained from a confluence of the intercellular matter, a resi- 
duum of the formless homogeneous substance (the cytoblastema) *, in 
which the cells filled with lime were formed. Let it be supposed 
that at the outer margin of every layer this substance remains 
without cells, and consequently hardens like horn. If these edges 
should close upon each other, then a smooth epidermis will arise; if 
they should remain more distant from each other, then a scaly, floc- 
culent or hairy covering will be formed. 

The colours, presented by bivalve and univalve shells, are de- 
posited only in their outermost parts, the inner layers are white. 
This may be explained by the circumstance, that the colouring 
matter is secreted especially by the edge of the mantle. But the 
mantle grows with the animal, and thus each succeeding layer of 
the shell is coloured at its outer margin alone, whilst its remaining 
portion, secreted by the rest of the surface of the mantle, remains 
white. In this way a series of coloured edges arises, which, closing 
upon each other, form the outermost coloured surface of a shell. 
There are however some univalves (the genus Cyprcea and some 
Olivce] in which, when full grown, the colours are deposited not on 
the surface alone, but also in a deeper layer, whilst at the same 
time the superficial and the more deeply lying colours are different. 
These molluscs are at first covered with a thin shell, of which the 
colours must be ascribed to the edge of the mantle. As the animal 
grows, lateral appendages of the mantle are developed, which throw 
themselves like wings over the shell, and secrete on their outer 



Reports of the British Association for 1844 and 1847. The chief particulars of these 
investigations may be also found in the Article Shell by the same writer in TODD'S

surface a calcareous layer as hard as ivory and of a different colour, 
which covers the preceding layers 1 . 

Many bivalve and univalve shells have on their inner surface 
lively and glancing colours, which must not be confounded with 
the external colours. They are the play of colours from the refrac- 
tion which is seen to arise on the transmission of white light 
through a prism, and which causes the beautiful phenomenon of the 
rain-bow. The mother of pearl therefore is not to be ascribed to 
any special colouring matter, but to very fine streaks and folds of 
the internal membrane of the shells 2 . It continues even after the 
carbonate of lime has been removed by an acid, and CARPENTER 
observed that the play of colour disappeared when he extended the 
membrane with needles so that the folds were obliterated 3 . These 
changes of colour are particularly beautiful in the genus Haliotis, a 
species of which is used by the Japanese to ornament the lackered 
furniture of their houses. 

Whenever the fluid, which forms this innermost layer of bi- 
valves, is effused in the form of small drops, pearls arise, which 
have frequently a very irregular shape. These may accordingly 
exist in very different species of bivalves, also in turbinate uni- 
valves; yet they arise usually in bivalves, and especially in Melea- 
grina margaritifera and Unio m,argaritiferus. The former species 
of conchifer is fished in the Persian gulph, the last is found in 
fresh water in different parts of Europe, and also in our country. 
According to HOME, pearls have undeveloped eggs for a nucleus, 
which have remained accidentally on the outside of the mantle 
within the shell. Such may often be the case, but there is no

SCHWEIGGER Handb. der Naturgesch. der sJcelettlosen ungeglied. Thiere, s. 68 1. A dif- 
ferent opinion of BRUGUIERE, that the animal of Cyprcea leaves its shell, and forms a 
new one, though adopted by LAMARCK and SCHWEIGGER, can no longer be defended ; 
compare DESHAYES in the new edition of LAMARCK Hist. nat. des Animaux s. Verti- 
Ires, x. p. 485. 

2 This was first announced by BREWSTER Phil. Trans. 1814. If a drop of sealing- 
wax be allowed to fall on a mother of pearl shell, the surface of the wax, which has 
been in contact with the shell, presents the same colours. It may be supposed that 
this was an impression of the surface. But it appears, that in this experiment a thin 
scale of the surface of the shell remains adhering to the wax.

reason why the formation of pearls should not be ascribed also to 
other irritants affecting the mantle. It has been observed at least 
that injuries of the shells and wounds, caused by boring worms, 
have had the production of pearls for a consequence ; and the secret 
of LINNAEUS for favouring the production of pearls (in Unio), con- 
sisted, most probably, in boring the shell in different places in con- 
chifers, which were submitted to these experiments 1 . 

The shells of molluscs, from their variety of colour and form, 
constitute no small part of the ornament of natural-history collec- 
tions. The knowledge of conchology is of the highest interest to 
the Geologist, since the petrified and extinct species afford im- 
portant characters for distinguishing the different strata. But, 
more than this, the knowledge of the molluscs is of great value to 
general physiology. To the celebrated Danish zoologist of the last 
century, O. F. MUELLER, the honour is principally due of having 
raised this part of natural history from the fondness of collectors to 
the scientific contemplation of naturalists; it was his impressive 
exhortation that thenceforward attention should not be confined 
solely to the house or the shell, but, above all, be extended 
to an accurate investigation of its inhabitant 2 . Already had SWAM- 
MERDAM in Holland, and MARTIN LISTER in England, investi- 
gated the internal structure of some molluscs. POLI and CUVIER 
made this subject a primary object of their numerous inquiries, and 
thus, in the course of the last fifty years, and even in our own day, 
i through the labours of DELLE CHIAJE, OWEN and others, a clear 
and extensive view has been obtained of a field of comparative 
I anatomy that previously was almost unknown. This was an inesti- 
I mable gain for a science which, if it is indeed to exercise an 
[important influence on physiology, must not, in any sense, be 
limited to a few classes of animals, but must, in reality, be com- 
paring, and must compare generally.

690 ON MOLLUSCS IN GENERAL. 

Some molluscs have no head distinct from the body. Here the 
principal mass of the nervous system is not placed near to or above 
the mouth, but if nervous ganglia be found in this situation, they 
are inferior in development and size to other nervous ganglia; 
no nerves for special organs of sense arise from the nervous mass 
situated above the oesophagus. The mouth conducts immediately 
into the oesophagus, and has no teeth or tongue. These are named 
headless molluscs (Acephala). The other molluscs have a head more 
or less clearly distinct. The head-bearing molluscs (Cephalophora 
or mollusca encephala) are more perfectly organised, and amongst 
them alone are species found which live on land ; most of the 
species, however, reside in the water, like the acephalous molluscs. 
These last may be arranged in two classes, the naked and the 
bivalve acephalous molluscs. 



CLASS XI. 
TUNTCATES (TUNIC AT A) 1 . 

THE Tunicates are acephalous molluscs without shells. The 
external covering is perforated by two openings, in other respects 
like a sac and entirely closed, of various thickness and hardness, in 
some gelatinous, in others leathery. It consists of a tissue that is 
sometimes very composite, includes cells, fibres, nuclei, crystals also 
of carbonate of lime, and of which the fundamental matter contains 
no nitrogen, but only oxygen and hydrogen, and agrees in compo- 
sition with the vegetable cell-membrane (cellulose), as was first 
discovered by C. SCHMIDT in Ascidia mammilaris 2 . 

The intestinal canal forms in most of the Salpce some convolu- 
tions, which are united to form a clue which occupies a small part 
alone of the cavity of the body, and to which FOESKAL in his 
descriptions gave the unmeaning name of Nucleus. In Salpa pennata 
s. cristata Cuv., however, the intestinal canal runs straight from 
the mouth to the opposite end, and has, close above and behind the 
mouth, an expansion or stomach that terminates blindly and lies in 
the opposite direction. The mouth, placed internally and bordered 
by a tortuous band, is properly only the beginning of the ossopha- 
TIS. A furrow in the middle of the body runs from the opening 
f the common integument, by which the water is introduced, to 
bis commencement of the oesophagus, and serves probably to con- 
.uct towards it the food that is conveyed with the water. [Above 
bis furrow or semicanal, in the substance of the inner mantle is 
n organ, called by HUXLEY endostyle, a long tubular filament 
vith thick refracting walls. It is of various length, very short in

Doliolum, extending in some Salpce as far as the oesophageal aper- 
ture. The tube is closed posteriorly, but, according to LEUCKART, 
communicates anteriorly with the longitudinal semicanal. Its walls 
are composed of large nucleated cells, arranged perpendicular to its 
cavity, and LEUCKART suggests that it may perform a secreting 
function. HUXLEY has seen it in Salpce, Pyrosomata and certain 
Botoryllidm, as well as in Cynthia^ and, as it seems to be figured 
by SAVIGNY and others, it may perhaps be concluded to be common 
to the Tumcata l .~\ 

In the AscidioR the intestinal canal usually forms two bends, 
which lie toward each other, and have their convexity facing back- 
wards. The intestinal canal commences at the bottom of the 
branchial cavity, and becomes narrower posteriorly. The stomach 
is sometimes merely indicated by a first expansion of the intestine, 
which is not sharply defined; in other cases its form is elongate and 
cylindrical, as in Didemnum and Botryllus*. The extremity of the 
intestinal canal mounts higher than the commencement of the 
oesophagus, in the direction of the second tubular opening of the 
external integument of the body. The liver lies as a stratum of 
glands on the walls of the stomach or the intestinal canal. Salivary 
glands have as little been met with here as in the bivalve molluscs. 

The blood-circulation of the tunicata presents the remarkable 
phenomenon, that the direction in which the blood streams from 
the heart is at intervals altogether reversed, so that the heart alter- 
nately drives the blood to the branchia3, and may be called venous, 
and alternately receives the blood from the branchia3 and, as in the 
rest of the invertebrates, is arterial. This peculiarity was first 
discovered in 1821 by VAN HASSELT in Salpa 3 , but was afterwards 
observed by LISTER, MILNE EDWARDS, VAN BENEDEN and others,

in the blood- current, and by E. H. WEBER (ibid. pp. 399, 400) in young leeches. 



TUNICATES. 693 

in different species of simple and compound Ascidice, so that it may 
be safely concluded to be a common property of the animals of this 
class. The heart has an elongate form and does not exhibit any 
sudden expansion and contraction, but a sinuously progressive 
constricting and widening, which is similar in form to the peri- 
staltic motion of the intestinal canal. Besides larger vessels the 
blood moves in interspaces which have no proper walls. 

The respiratory organs are gills which are very different from 
those of the bivalve molluscs. In the genus Salpa the gill is 
extended as a longitudinal band running obliquely in the inner 
cavity of the tubular body, with many transverse grooves closely 
arranged side by side. In the Ascidice the respiratory organ forms 
a sac at the bottom of which the entrance to the oesophagus is 
situated. The very thin membrane, of which the sac consists, 
presents transverse and longitudinal stripes that cross each other at 
right angles like trellis-work, to which a net-work of blood-vessels 
corresponds. The gills, as well of the Salpce as of the Ascidice, 
are beset with vibratile cilia J . 

Male and female organs are, at least in the Ascidice, united in 
the same individual. Often they are intimately connected with each 
other and are only to be distinguished by microscopic examination 
of their content. Some Ascidice, as Ascidia ampullaris V. BENED., 
have quite a double apparatus of sexual organs, which lies behind 
in the intestinal sac on each side of the intestinal canal. In some 
the oviduct is wanting, in others no vas deferens exists; a single, 
long, tortuous canal, which is present in the compound Ascidice, 
and is generally held to be the oviduct, ought, according to MILNE 
EDWARDS, to be regarded as the vas deferens. In the Ascidice, 
besides the usual propagation by impregnated eggs, a multiplication 
by buds has also been detected 2 . 



1 MILNE EDWAKDS and before him LISTEE admit openings like fissures between the 
quadrangular meshes by which the water is expelled from the branchial sac (MlLNE 
EDWAEDS Observ. s. I. Asc. cornp. pp. 17 20). It is difficult to determine, in speci- 
mens preserved in spirit, whether they are really openings or spaces closed by a trans- 
parent membrane. [HUXLEY says that in Pyrosoma, the respiratory cavity communi- 
cates freely by means of apertures in the branchial network with the post-branchial or 
anal cavity. Phil. Trans. 1851, p. 581.] 

2 Compare for some other peculiarities, the notice of the different genera in the 
systematic arrangement, in which also the remarkable propagation of the Salpce is 
noticed. 



694 CLASS xi. 

The nervous system presents a single ganglion, which in the 
Ascidice is placed on the internal covering of the body, usually 
regarded as the mantle, between the two tubes into which the body 
is elongated. Besides other nerves which radiate from this ganglion, 
there appears to arise from it a nervous ring that surrounds the 
tube by which the water penetrates (the oral and respiratory tube). 
Other ganglia which are noticed in Ascidians by some writers, are at 
the least to be regarded as doubtful 1 . In Salpa a ganglion (or a 
nerve-mass formed of several ganglia united) lies close behind the 
anterior, broader opening on that surface of the body which is directed 
upwards 2 . Several nerves run radiately from this nerve-mass. 

Vestiges of organs of sense are not entirely absent. In the 
Ascidice at the branchial aperture a circlet of small filiform feelers, 
sometimes digitally incised or pennated, is found. In the Salpce 
there lies in front of the central mass of the nervous system an 
organ of an elongated form, consisting of two laminae with an 
internal margin smooth and an external striated, which ESCHRICHT 
regards as an organ of feeling and compares with the four lamellae 
which surround the mouth in bivalve molluscs 3 . Organs of sight 
also have been observed in the Ascidice. There are found both 
around the branchial aperture of the mantle and around the aper- 
ture towards which the extremity of the intestinal canal proceeds, 
a ring of eye-points, often of a yellow colour 4 . [In Salpce a vesicle 



1 Thus SCHALK, whose Dissert, de Ascidiarum Structure*, I am acquainted with 
from citations alone, records a nerve-ganglion in the posterior part of the body, 
between the convolutions of the intestine ; GRANT speaks even of three ganglia, Out- 
lines of Comp. Anat. 1811, pp. 205, 206. Compare on the nervous system of the 
Ascidice, CUVIER Sur les Ascidics, p. 15, PI. n. fig. 2, c, fig. 5, g. SAVIGNY Mem,. 2,

2 This position of the central portion of the nervous system caused ESCHRICHT to 
give to the surface the name of ventral side. See on the nervous system of Salpa

gustatory function. It floats freely in the respiratory cavity to which it is attached by 
its base.]

eye-points lie round the branchial opening, and six around the efferent tube ; so also,

attached to the lower surface of the nerve-mass and containing 
calcareous bodies would seem to represent the auditory capsule and 
its otolithes l .~\ Such an organ also, but containing a concrement of 
a more composite form, was discovered by ESCHRICHT, similarly 
situated in a simple Ascidian Ghelyosoma Macleayanum, and noted 
as the auditory organ 2 in 1841. 

The muscular system in Ascidice consists of a layer of fibres, 
which cross each other on the inner covering of the body (the so- 
called mantle), but run principally in a longitudinal direction. In 
the Salpcz muscular bands are seen remote from each other, which, 
like a girdle not entirely closed at one part, surround the internal 
cavity of the body, the respiratory space. These bands consist of 
fibres that run parallel to each other in the direction of the bands, 
and thus form a right angle with the longitudinal axis of the body. 

On the position of these animals in the natural system there 
can exist no doubt when they are referred to the common type of 
the molluscs. They must be regarded as the lowest division of 
these animals, that immediately close in upon the bivalves. The 
compound Ascidians in propagating by gems remind us of lower 
animals of the class of the Polyps. More especially still do the 
Ascidians resemble the Bryozoa (comp. I. pp. 92, 93), but we should 
prefer to unite these last with the Mollusca, rather than on account 
of this affinity to separate the Tunicata from the Mollusca. 

Species of this class are met with in all seas. The Salpce are 
numerous in the Mediterranean and in the ocean, especially between 
30 and 40 N. and S. Lat., in colder regions and in higher latitudes 
they are of more rare occurrence although they extend to 50 N. 
and S. Lat., and were once observed near the Norwegian coast even

this class. MILNE EDWARDS (see the figures of Salpa referred to above in the illus- 
trated edition of CUVIER) thinks that it must be regarded as an organ of vision.

in 62 N. Lat. 1 They appear on the coasts, however, only rarely, 
but keep by preference in the open sea, far from the continent. 
Ascidians, as well compound as simple, occur in much higher lati- 
tudes ; Boltenia ovifera was discovered in Davis' s Straits at 69 
N. L., Synoicum turgens in Phipps's voyage at the north coast of 
Spitzbergen. Species of all the forms, nay, even of most of the 
sub-genera, are found in the Mediterranean sea; the apparent pre- 
ponderance in number of species in this sea, above all others, may 
however be principally ascribed perhaps to this, that its productions 
have been more perseveringly investigated by numerous observers, 
than those of the other seas.

Observations upon the Anatomy and Physiology of Salpa and Pyrosoma. Phil. 
Trans. 1851, Pt. II. p. 567. 

The species of Salpce are very generally dispersed ; sometimes 
they are met with in incredible quantities together j notwithstand- 
ing, these animals a century ago were entirely unknown. The first 
announcement of them was made by P. BROWN in his Civil and 
Natural History of Jamaica, published in 1756, under the name of 
Thalia; afterwards followed the description of the species observed 
in the Mediterranean and Red Sea, under that of Salpa by the 
Danish traveller FORSKAL'. Bosc and CUVIER next pointed out 
the resemblance of these animal species, described under two differ- 
ent names, which ought to be referred to the self-same genus. 

The body has an aperture at each extremity, but these apertures 
have a different form. The one is broad and transverse, and presents 
a valvular membrane, inasmuch as one of its margins is reflected 
inwards. The valvular membrane prevents the efflux of the water, 
which flows inwards by this opening and which is expelled by the 
opposite one from the contraction of the body. This expulsion of the 
water is the means by which the animal moves, so that the narrower 
opening is turned backwards. CUVIER thought that this opening 
was the anterior, and that thus the animal moved backwards. 
Since, however, the stream of water conducts also the food, and 
since in the Ascidice the entrance to the oesophagus is situated 
behind in the respiratory sac, the common opinion, that the broad 
opening is the anterior, deserves to be preferred to this idea. The 
intestinal canal is situated on the outside of the respiratory cavity, 
in the space intervening between the external and internal covering, 
but terminates by both its apertures in the respiratory cavity. 

These animals, according to the testimony of PERON, TILESIUS, 
MEYEST and others, are usually phosphorescent by night. The Salpce 
are met with at one time singly, as distinct individuals, at another, 
united either in rings or in long chains, of which the arrangement 
is various, yet similar in individuals of one and the same species. 
These are attached to each other by tubercles or prolongations. 
CHAMISSO, from his observations on living animals, arrived at 
the conclusion, that successively a generation of distinct Salpce 
alternates with that of Salpce connected, and forming a chain. 
Thus a metamorphosis occurs, which, however, does not take place 



1 BRUGUIKRE, who gave in the Encycl. method, an extract from the descriptions of 
FORSK., changed the name Salpa into Biphora, which has found no general acceptance. 



TUNICATA. 699 

in the same individual, but in two succeeding generations. The 
parent animal, for instance, always resembles her grand-daughter 
and her sister, not her daughter, which, again, resembles the pre- 
ceding generation. This conclusion seemed to most succeeding 
observers so strange, that they thought it could not be adopted j 
MEYEN supposed that these animals are always born as single 
individuals, and only become united subsequently. Nevertheless, 
ESCHRICHT discovered within single individuals embryos connected 
together in a wreath, so that hereby CHAMISSO'S conclusion was 
established, that chains of connected Salpce were formed even 
within the parent. STEENSTRUP brought this peculiarity in the 
propagation of the Salpce into unison with other phenomena in the 
animal kingdom, in his interesting work, Om Fortplantning og 
Udvikling gjenem Generationsrackher, (see above, p. 70), and the 
meritorious Norwegian observer SARS, completely confirmed it 
(Faun, littor. Norvegice). With it too the numerous observations 
lately communicated by KROHN, are in accordance. The solitary 
Salpw are sexless, and are propagated by internal germs or buds 
connected in strings. Hence the associated form appears to be 
the most perfect, that in which organs of propagation are developed, 
(and organs of impregnation also, testes) ; each individual of the 
associated Salpce produces only a single young one.

\Appendicularia CHAMISSO, QUOY and GAIM. (Oikopleura MERTENS). 
Body irregularly ovate, with a long appendage attached to the

ing immediately on the dorsal surface in front of the base of

There has been much doubt respecting the place and the nature of 
Appendicularia. CHAMISSO, who found his species in the N. Pacific, con- 
sidered it to be a Medusa allied to genus Cesium. ESCHSCHOLTZ, who 
observed the same, or a nearly allied species, in the South Sea, referred it 
to the Heteropod Molluscs, whilst MERTENS, who voyaged in the same 
seas, thought it was a Pteropod related to Clio. See CHAMISSO Nov. Act.

regards Appendicularia as a larval state of some Ascidian, all of which have 
an appendage in the early condition, whilst with HUXLEY (On Appendicu- 
laria and Doliolum, Phil. Trans. 1851, p. 595) and GEGENBAUER (SIEBOLD

1 [These tubes were first discovered by GEGENBAUER, but from the great transpa- 
rency, he did not detect their openings on the surface of the animals, but supposed them 
to conduct the fluid from the respiratory cavity, in order either to mix it directly with the 
blood, or by expanding more largely to bring it in near contact with the blood through 
their thin walls. See his paper, pp. 415, 416. HUXLEY, as well by direct observation 
as by feeding his animals on indigo, saw clearly the external apertures of the tubes in 
front, and on each side of the anus. In one observation he found the current to set in 
at these apertures, and out at the anterior opening of the respiratory sac. See his 
paper on Appendicularia flabellum, Quarterly Journal of Micros. Sc. No. 15, 1856, 
pp. 181 191.] 



TUNICATA. 701 

ORDER II. TetJiyonidea. 

Body sacciform, with two apertures mostly approximate. Cover- 
ing coriaceous or gelatinous, mostly opaque. Branchial sac large, 
reticulato-fenestrate, with rectangular areolse; the beginning of 
oesophagus situated at the bottom of this sac. Animals mostly 
affixed. Propagation oviparous and gemmiparous. 

To this order some compound animals belong which were formerly 
referred, for the most part, to the Alcyonidia (see above, p. 78). 
The discovery of their true affinity is one of the most interesting 
results of the accurate investigations of SAVIGNY. Compare on this 
order the above-cited works of this author, as well as those of MILNE 
EDWARDS, VAN BENEDEN, &c. 

Besides the two divisions of Ascidice into simple and compound, 
MILNE EDWARDS has adopted a third, that of the social Ascidice, 
which are distinguished by forming gems, without being grown 
together like the compound Ascidians. This gemmation has, how- 
ever, been noticed in a species ordinarily simple 1 , and may perhaps 
occur in all the animals of this division. 

Young Ascidians, which do not originate in gemmation but 
proceed from eggs, undergo an interesting metamorphosis. In the 
early stage they move freely, and are provided with a long tail, as 
was communicated by MILNE EDWARDS (Ann. des Sc. nat. xv. p. 10), 
as early as 1828, and was afterwards more fully described by 
Y. BENEDEN and others. They fix themselves by that extremity 
which is opposite to the tail, which they then lose 2 . In compound 
Ascidians, according to the observations of SARS on Botrylhtg, such 
a cercarise-forni larva may already enclose a group (eight) of united 
Ascidians. Thus, even before the Ascidia has become attached, by 
the division of the gem the commencement is made of a colony 
which is capable of further multiplication by the formation of 
gems. Not, however, in all compound Ascidians is this original

connexion to be detected, not at least, according to MILNE EDWARDS, 
in Polyclinuni. 

Family II. Lucice. Apertures of external covering opposite, 
terminal. Branchial sac girdled anteriorly by a membranous denti- 
culate ring, open posteriorly. Several animals aggregated to form 
a compound body swimming freely, cylindrico-conical, hollow 
internally. 

Pyrosoma PEKON. 

This genus of compound Ascidice was first discovered by PERON and 
his fellow-voyagers in the Atlantic ocean under the Tropics, when in 
a dark night numerous specimens of it appeared to form a broad 
band of light across the sea. From this phosphoric quality, the 
name (Fire-body) is derived. At first these compound animals were 
supposed to be a single animal, and the single individuals of which 
a Pyrosoma is compounded, to be little tubercles on the surface 
of the animal. See PERON Mem. sur le nouveau genre Pyrosoma, 
Ann. du Museum, iv. pp. 437 446. For a more accurate know- 
ledge of this remarkable genus we are indebted almost exclusively 
to the investigations of SAVIGNY. The compound body is a much- 
elongated cone, ordinarily six or seven inches in length, open at 
one end and at the other closed and bluntly rounded off. The 
little animals are placed perpendicularly to the axis of the cone, in 
circles more or less irregular, whilst the posterior openings of their 
body terminate in the cavity of the cone. The gem, according 
to the observations of SAVIGNY, is already cloven into four animals 
even before they are born. This is the commencement of the cylin- 
der or cone, which may be imagined to be formed of a series of 
circles or girdles of small Ascidice behind each other of increasing 
size ; the thinner closed extremity of the compound body is thus 
the first formed. Consult SAVIGNY 1. cit. pp. 58, 206.

TUNICATA. 705 

the name of Ascidium (Natuurk. Uitspanningen, i. bl. 97), and 
LINNAEUS, in the twelfth edition of his Systema Naturae, changed 
this name, without any reason that I am aware of, into Ascidia. 

These Ascidice or bag-pipes (zakpijpen*), as BASTER names them, 
are always attached to other bodies, to rocks, shells, crabs, &c. Often 
several individuals are united in a single group ; they never, how- 
ever, form such a compound body as the preceding genera, which 
are distinguished by the orificia analia being always turned towards 
each other, and more or less really united, (SAVIGNY, op. cit. p. 120), 
whilst the external covering is common to all the individuals that 
combine to form the group. 

These animals ingurge water through the branchial aperture, and 
eject it chiefly by the same aperture in jets, which may serve as 
a defensive means for chasing animals away that attack them. 
CUVIER asserts that the expulsion of water can be performed 
through the branchial aperture alone. Those writers, however, who 
have observed them alive, are unanimous in their testimony that the 
ejection of water is effected through both apertures. CARUS tells, 
that in a large specimen of Ascidia microcosmus he saw an opening 
furnished with a membranous valve, which appeared to lead from 
the branchial sac to the porus analis. Other writers, however, do 
not speak of such an opening. On the supposition of LISTER and 
MILNE EDWARDS that the branchial sac is perforated like a sieve 
(see above, p. 693), the matter may be explained without difficulty. 
Whether Ascidians also ingurge water by the cloacal aperture after 
a vacuum in the gill-sac has been caused by contraction, as SAVIGNY 
suspected (pp. cit. p. 100), deserves further investigation. 

Ascidians live on small organic particles, which are brought with 
the water into the respiratory sac and thence to the (esophagus that 
opens at its bottom. Sometimes, indeed, small crustaceans have 
been found in the sac, but they would seem to have arrived there 
fortuitously; for when they have been ingurged by an Ascidian they 
are rather hurtful than beneficial, and in some cases even injure the 
tissue of the gills. 

EYSENHARDT has published observations from which it appears that the 
body of Ascidians in a singular manner may change into a formless mass, 
on which other Ascidjans attach themselves, and take root. Nov. Act.

CLASS XII. 
CONCHIFERS (CONCHIFERA^. 

WITH LAMARCK we unite all the "bivalve molluscs in a single 
class, which also contains the Brachiopoda of CUVIER. They are 
acephalous molluscs, of which the mantle is always more or less, 
and often entirely, cloven into two laminse, and which are covered 
by a bivalve shell. Their respiratory apparatus is external, and 
situated either between the mantle and the body in form of plates, 
or in the substance of the mantle itself. 

The intestinal canal, very various in length, is closely sur- 
rounded by the other viscera. The oesophagus is short, or there 
exists no oesophagus obviously distinct. Ordinarily a stomach is 
present, yet in Ligula the intestinal canal is almost of the same 
width throughout; and in Orbicula also a stomachal expansion is 
not apparent. Salivary glands are not present in the Lamelli- 
branchiata ; in the Bracliiopoda it is doubtful whether one of the 
glandular masses, that surround the intestinal canal, is to be 
regarded as a salivary gland 2 . Largely developed on the other 
hand is the liver, which, as in the rest of the invertebrate animals, 
receives arterial blood alone, and has no gall-bladder. Numerous 
lobes, consisting either of blind sacs or of branching coecal tubes, 



1 Most of the general works on this class treat also of the rest of the molluscs, and 
have been partly cited above. Here belongs especially the great work of POLL Com- 
pare besides, the article Conchifera, of DESK AYES in TODD'S Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and 
Physiology, i. 1836, pp. 694 716, and R. GARNER, On the Anatomy of the lamclli- 
branchiate Conchifera, Trans, of the Zool. Soc. n. i, pp. 87 101, PI. 18 20. 

2 In Ligula Anatina CUVIER observed a difference of colour in these glandular 
masses, which led him to consider the round white gland, situated in the middle, to be 
salivary, the lateral, divided into many lobes, and yellow brown, to be a liver. OWEN 
could not perceive such difference of colour in Lingula Audebardii, and supposes that, 
in the specimens examined by CUVIER, it was to be ascribed to some accidental cause, 
as bleaching by the spirit in which the animals were kept (Trans. Zool. Soc. I. p. I5/)- 
I must, however, observe that the specimen examined by me gave the same results as 
CUVIER has noticed, although I do not regard difference in colour as a certain proof of 
difference in function. In the other genera of Brachiopoda, which I have not examined; 
Terebratula and Orbicula, OWEN found no glands except the liver.

surround the stomach and intestine, and pour the "bile by more than 
one opening into their cavity. In many Lamellibranchmta there is 
found, either in a blind appendage at the undermost part of the 
stomach, or in the intestine itself below the stomach, a transpa- 
rent elongated organ (the crystal style) , on that extremity of which 
that projects freely into the stomach, a small membranous cartilagi- 
nous protuberance, divided into three or more irregular processes 
or points, is seated 1 . The use of this apparatus is not yet rightly 
understood. POLI thinks the elasticity of the organ may press the 
points of the protuberance towards and into the openings of the 
gall-ducts, and thus moderate the influx of bile when not required ; 
but such a regulator is unexampled in the animal kingdom. That 
the style may effect the recoil of the foot, has been suggested by 
GARNER, without any accurate explanation of the mode in which 
this is produced, whilst, at the same time, the free projection into 
the stomach of the tricuspid protuberance remains unexplained. 
We confess rather that we do not yet understand the organ, 
because we can compare it with no other in the rest of the classes 
of animals. 

The circulation of the blood has in this class always a central 
organ, a heart with a single ventricle, sometimes two hearts remote 
from each other; for instance, in the Brachiopoda and in Area 
amongst the Lamellibranchiata'*. In this case, however, the two 
learts fulfil the same office on each side of the body, and are both 
arterial like the single heart in the rest of the acephalous molluscs : 
blood, namely, flows from the gills to the heart, not from the 



1 POLI names this protuberance sagitta tricuspis; see on this subject his celebrated 
work Testae, utr. Sicil. I. Introd. p. 41, and the figures for example, from Pholas 
dactylus, Tab. VII. figs. 9, 10, IT, from Tellina planata, Tab. XIV. figs. 9, 10, from 
Cardium rusticum, Tab. XVI. figs. 13, &c. The circumstance that the crystal style is 

ometimes not to be found, and, as V. SIEBOLD thinks, is developed and disappears 
)eriodically (Lehrb. d. vergl. Anat. I. s. 263, note 15), indicates an analogy with the 
apides cancrorum (see above, p. 616) that promises, perhaps, to throw a clearer light 
upon it.

heart to the gills. When a single heart is present, it is usually 
seated between the two membranous triangular auricles that have 
their points turned towards the heart. From the heart arise the 
arteries, which, however, do not pass from capillaries into veins ; 
the arterial blood flows, according to the interesting discovery of 
MILNE EDWARDS 1 , not through closed vessels, but in reticular inter- 
spaces (lac-unce), which are emptied into larger venous sinuses, [or 
rather the so-called close vessels expand, their attenuated proper 
tunic being continued into these lacunae and sinuses 2 ]. 

The respiratory organs are, in the Brachiopoda, situated on the 
mantle, or the vascular mantle itself serves for respiration. In the 
Lamellibranchiata the gills lie as plates between the margins of 
the mantle. Ordinarily two gills are present on each side. Each 
gill consists of two plates, which are more remote from each other 
on the dorsal surface, and coalescent at their free outer margin. 
Sometimes the triangular spaces which are thus formed in the gills 
are capable of a great extension, and serve, as in Anodonta, as tem- 
porary repositories for the eggs, brooding cavities. On each plate 
numerous transverse stripes or projecting lines are seen, along 
which the currents of blood pass in the gills. In Area, Pecten, and 
Spondylus, each of these projecting lines is changed into a free fila- 
ment, and the gills thus consist here not of plates but of threads, 
which, though separate, are still from their numbers placed close 
together 3 . The gills in this condition resemble those of bony 
fishes, whilst the laminated structure, which in the Lamettibran- 
chiata is that generally prevalent, occurs in these fishes (in Xipliias 
gladius) only as the exception. Another deviation from the ordi- 
nary type of the gills is seen in some genera of Lamettibranchiata 
in the number of these organs, when on each side, instead of two, 
only a single gill is present 4 . From the common opinion that the

plates described are gills, BOJANUS entirely recedes ; he thinks that 
the only office of these organs is the custody of the eggs, whence 
he does not name them gills, but brood-receptacles (Bruthalter) . 
Accordingly he has described an entirely different organ, not 
noticed previously, as a respiratory organ 1 . According to his ob- 
servations the venous blood, that flows back from the organs of 
the body, is conducted to an elongated venous sinus situated at 
the dorsal surface beneath the heart. Close to this sinus are 
two spongy, dark-green or brown sacs, which are very rich in ves- 
sels, and receive all the blood from the venous sinus. BOJANUS 
was of opinion that these organs serve for respiration, and are 
lungs; from each sac arises a single vascular stem, which runs 
along the two gills of its own side. From the parts which BOJANUS 
names lungs, come also some short vessels, which run immediately 
to the heart, but the greater part of the blood that flows in them 
goes to the two vascular stems of the gill-plates. 

The investigations of BOJANUS have made us much more accu- 
rately acquainted with the circulation of the blood in Lamelli- 
branchiata, than what had previously been written upon it. The 
mode, however, in which this anatomist explained what he observed, 
is exposed to many objections. If his opinions be not adopted, it 
is not clear what appellation ought to be assigned to the organs 
described by BOJANUS. At the present day it seems that these so- 
named lungs are very commonly regarded as kidneys 2 . On this 
supposition, however, it remains unexplained why they receive 
all the venous blood of the body. This circumstance deserves 
special consideration, whenever a conclusion is attempted con- 
cerning the nature of these organs. Hence it is that I offered, 
now more than twenty years ago, the opinion that these so- 
called lungs are venous sinuses, as much as the part that lies

are parts which correspond to the lateral venous sinuses of the 
decapod crustaceans (see above, p. 605), and to the two lateral 
venous hearts in the Cephalopoda dibranchiata 1 . Consequently the 
two arterial stems of the gills convey venous blood, which, having 
become arterial in the gills, is brought back to the heart by four 
branchial veins (two on each side). The walls of these venous 
sinuses may at the same time be regarded as secreting organs, 
which correspond to the appendages of the veins in the Cephalopoda. 
Each of these sinuses, moreover, is situated in a cavity or a space 
with thin walls, to which the water has free access by a fissure 
which opens close to the external opening of the genital organs. 

Besides the circulation of the blood in vessels and in spaces 
without proper walls, as already described, another system still of 
canals or interspaces has been discovered, that is filled with 
water in conchifers, as in many other invertebrate animals 2 . It is 
probable that in the description of the circulating system of the 
blood, a confusion with these canals has occasionally occurred 3 . 

It was generally supposed formerly, that all the conchifers 
were of one sex, not so much bisexual, as indeed all female, there 
being no other organs of propagation except ovaries 4 . But if 
such were really the case, these animals ought not to be styled 
female, but sexless. An organ for the preparation of germs could 
not, when the germ required no impregnation, be an ovary; the 
germ which, without the influence of sperma is developed into a 
new animal, ought rather to be named a detached bud than an

V. SIEBOLD advances as my opinion, and with which he professes to agree, that the 
parts described by BOJANUS correspond to the appendages of the veins in Cepkalopods, 
is not mine, but indeed a later guess of BOJANUS himself (Isis 1820), who in fact had 
too much love of truth to conceal that his opinion respecting the respiration of 
conchifers was something of a paradox (eine in ironischer Anwandlung, etwas keck und 
paradox ausgcsprochene Meinung}.

egg 1 . We have already seen above in the case of the sea-nettles 
and echinoderms, that the sexual glands (ovaria, testes) might agree 
entirely in position and external form, so that, without microscopic 
investigation of their contents, it could not be determined whether 
they were feminine or masculine, whether they served to prepare 
the germ or to impregnate it. In the Brachiopoda the ovary alone 
is known hitherto, which lies behind the liver ; from the ovary the 
eggs arrive at the lobes of the mantle, and cover the blood-vessels 
that are distributed there 2 . In the Lamellibranchiata PREVOST 
discovered in 1823 distinct sexes in Unto 3 . In the male sex, in 
place of the ovary, a similarly formed part is found, filled with 
white fluid, which swarms with seminal animalcules. PREVOST 
saw neither from these nor from those that had ovaries any young 
ones proceed when he kept them apart, but did when two were 
placed in contiguity. These observations were confirmed some 
years afterwards by others of the same kind, of WAGNER, MILNE 
EDWARDS, and others, and especially by very exact investigations 
of C. T. VON SiEBOLD 4 . In the mean time, this interesting pecu- 
liarity is no new discovery of the last years ; and the observations 
which have been alluded to tend to the confirmation rather of what 
had already been observed by LEEUWENHOECK a century and a half 
earlier 6 . The spermatozoa have a long thin tail and a conspicuously 
distinct body, like a knob, which is very small and elongated. 
The testes in the male individuals are situated at the same part as 
the ovaries in the females ; they open at the same place, and appear 
in the arrangement of their blind tubes to agree with the ovaries. 
Now that it has been admitted that difference of sex exists in the

Lamellibranchmta, perhaps hereafter external sexual difference 
will be looked for. In Anodonta, at least, the females may be 
recognised by their more convex shells 1 . However all Lamelli- 
branchiata, are not of different sex ; Pecten, for instance, according 
to MILNE EDWAKDS, is hermaphroditic 2 ; also in Cyclas, besides 
the ovaries, two testes are present 3 . 

The structure of the ovaries has, by the investigations of POLI, 
become known in many genera of Lamellibranchiata. The two 
ovaries lie on each side of the intestinal canal and the liver, and 
consist of tubes that divide into branches terminating blindly; 
they have often a proper colour, ordinarily red or rose-red, by 
which they are distinguished from the neighbouring parts. The 
eggs pass from the ovary by an aperture situated on each side of 
the foot or the abdomen, at the inside of the opening of the 
vacuities in which the venous sinuses are contained. In the same 
situation lie the apertures by which in the male conchifers the 
sperma is evacuated. Afterwards the eggs proceed along the foot 
into an opening between the foot and the inner gills, and arrive 
at the canal of the inner gills, which conducts to the cloaca. From 
here the eggs are carried to the lobes of the mantle, or they come 
outward and are brought by the respiratory streams from behind 
into the canal of the external gills, and deposited between the 
plates in the saccules of these gills, as in Unto and Anodonta*.

investigated; WIEGMANN'S Archiv, 1835, II. s. 218, Tab. in. fig. 8. The presence of 
two testes and two ovaria in genus Cyclas was observed by V. SIEBOLD, MUELLER'S 
Archiv, 1837, s. 383, 384. [See on the genital organs of Lamellibranchiata, H. LECAZE- 
DUTHIERS Ann. des Sc. Nat., Zool. 4'ieme Serie, Tom. n. .pp. 155248. He adds 
Ostrea, so much contested, to the list of the hermaphrodites. Pecten, which is usually 
bisexual, has one species (Pecten varius) unisexual, whilst Cardium, usually unisexual, 
has Cardium serratum and Card. Icevigatum bisexual. In some hermaphrodites, the 
sexual organs, though united in the body of the same animal, are quite distinct (Pecten, 
&c.), in others they are quite confused, (Ostrea).'] 

4 The figure of POLI Testae, utriusq. Sicil. I. Tab. IX. fig. 18, gives a good idea of 
these chambers formed by transverse septa, triangular and much elongated, which have 
their bases turned to the dorsal side of the gills. POLI and most observers have found 
the eggs in the external gills alone, BOJANUS occasionally found some in the internal 
also. Thus the respiratory function is not prevented by these eggs ; but only partially 
interrupted, and since there are many conchifcra in which the gills do not serve for the 
reception of eggs, there is the less reason for refusing to these organs the function of 



CONCHIFERS. 715 

Here the eggs remain for development. Since the young Anodonts 
and Unios in the early period of life have a form differing from 
the perfect animal, they have by some writers been regarded as 
parasites that live in the gills 1 . It is almost needless to say that, 
in the Lamellibranckiata, where the sexes are distinct, there is no 
copulation. The eggs must leave the ovarium previously to im- 
pregnation. 

The nervous system was by POLI, whose investigations have 
contributed so much to the knowledge of the structure of con- 
chifers, described as aqui-vascular system, since the wide neurilema 
admitted impletion with quicksilver. MANGILI contested this 
opinion. He observed four nervous ganglia in Anodonta, two at 
the side of the mouth, one, the largest of all, in the foot, and a 
fourth under the posterior occludent muscle of the shell, from which 
ganglion the nerves for the gills and the mantle arise. All these 
ganglia are mutually connected by nerve-filaments 2 . This may be 
regarded as the first exposition, in some measure accurate, of the 
nervous system in this class. As the rule, three central nerve- 
masses may be admitted in the Lamettibranchiata, each consisting 
of two lateral ganglia, of which, however, the first two alone are 
constantly distinct from each other. These lie near the mouth, and 
are connected by a longer or shorter transverse arched filament, a 
commissure which runs in front of the mouth. On each side there 
arises from these ganglia a long nerve-cord that runs to the poste- 
rior nerve-mass, the ganglia abdominalia, often connected in a single 
ganglion, and thus forms a wide ring which may be compared to 
the cesophageal ring in other invertebrate animals. The second 



respiration, so generally attributed to them ; to say nothing of the male individuals in 
which the temporary function for the gills of brooding organs entirely falls to the 
ground.

nerve-mass, the par pedale. t also connected with the first ganglia by 
two shorter strings, is, in those genera that have no foot, feebly 
developed, or according to GARNER, even absent. The nerve- 
ganglia are usually distinguished by a red or orange colour 1 . The 
nervous system of the Brachiopoda is not yet perfectly known, but 
seems to be formed after a different typus 2 . 

Amongst the parts which may be regarded as the seats of senses, 
the conical cirri are first to be noticed, which are present sometimes 
along the entire margin of the mantle of the Lamellibranchiata, or on 
some parts of the mantle, at the opening of the siphon for example, 
and which in the Brachiopoda are changed for long, stiff, glistering 
hairs. The mouth, moreover, in the Lamellibranchiata is surrounded 
by two pairs of transversely striped organs of touch of considerable 
size, triangular, elongated or oval laminas, which some consider to 
be accessory gills, from their external resemblance to these organs. 
In the Brachiopoda there are two long arms, beset pectinately with 
filaments like a fringe, situated at the side of the mouth, where 
they are rolled up in a spiral form, and concealed within the shell. 
Organs of vision have, of late years, been shewn by microscopic 
investigation to be present in Pecten, Spondylus, and many other 
genera amongst the Lamellibranchiata, as green, red-yellow, or 
brown tubers, shining brightly, and often set upon a small pedicle 
at the margin of the mantle. In different species more than a hun- 
dred such eyes have been counted 3 . 



1 Compare K. GARNER On the nervous system of Molluscous Animals, Trans, of Linn. 
Soc. xvn. 1835, PP- 485 488, PI. 24; BLANCHARD Observations surle Systeme nerveux 
des Mollusques lamellibranches, Ann. des Sc. not., 3ieme SeVie, in. 1845, pp. 321 340, 
PI. 12. Here may be found a copious historical review of this subject. The two small 
nerve-ganglia that lie near the oval ganglia in Ostrea (BRANDT and RATZEBU RG Medizin. 
Zool. IT. s. 340, 341), BLANCHARD regards as answering to the^ar pedale (here want- 
ing according to GARNER). Nervous branches that arise from the lateral commissural 
string of the first and hindmost pair, on which in some species (Solen, Area) even gan- 
gliform swellings are observed, correspond, so it appears, to the sympathetic nervous 
system of articulate animals, especially to the lateral portions of it in the crays, which 
in like manner arise from the collar round the neck (see above, p. 618). Those lamelli- 
branchiates, which are provided with a tubular prolongation of the mantle, have often 
between the muscles, that retract the tube, small nerve-ganglia in addition.

the side of the mouth. Trans, of Zool. Soc. I. p. 156. [On the nervous system of Tcre-

CONCHIFEKS. 717 

As auditory organ, SIEEOLD regards a part met with by him in 
Cyclas, Anodonta, Unio, My a, Cardium, Tellina, &c., an organ 
situated in front of and near to the nerve-mass of the foot. Here 
namely on both sides he found a vesicle in which a flat, round, 
transparent nucleus is in free motion. The nucleus is a concrement 
comparable to the lapilli in the auditory sac of the bony fishes 1 . 
Neither of this enigmatical organ nor of eyes has any vestige been 
met with in the Brachiopoda. 

The motions of these animals are very simple. Many Lamelli- 
branchiata, and all the Brachiopods, are fixed to their places, and 
are not able to move from them. Other conchifers have a springing 
motion by means of the foot, a name given to a production of the 
abdomen which is muscular and very firm, possesses great con- 
tractility and irritability, and may assume very different forms 2 . 
By means of it bivalves move at the bottom of the water in which 
they live. 

The geographic distribution of conchifers deserves a more 
special investigation than has hitherto been bestowed upon it. 
All conchifers live in water, part of them in Afresh water, but 
the greatest part in the sea. Amongst the genera that live in 
the sea are some of which species are met with in all parts of 
the world, as genera Solen, Mi/a, Anatina, Mactra, Tellina, Lu~ 
cina, Donax, Venus, Cardium, Area, Pectunculus, Mytilus, Pecten, 
Ostrea. It is however far from the fact that all these genera 
are found in like manner in different seas ; of the genera Venus, 
Cardium, Area, Ostrea, the species are much more numerous in 
the Indian Sea and the South Pacific, than in seas of the northern 
hemisphere. Glyciimris appears to be a northern form, of which 



(ib. p. 153); they are particularly large and conspicuous in the species last named 
(Tab. 27, figs. 5, 14); POLI was not able to investigate their internal structure; and 
the later writers on the molluscs neglected this peculiarity altogether. Only within 
the last few years has it been adequately illustrated by GRUBE (MUELLER'S Archiv , 
1840, s. -24, Taf. in. figs, i, 3), KROHN (ib. s. 381 386, Taf. xi. fig. 16) and WILL

genus the only species hitherto known, Glycimeris siliqua, is 
found very abundantly on the great bank of Newfoundland. More 
numerous, on the other hand, are the forms which occur exclu- 
sively in warm seas or in the southern hemisphere, or of which 
one or only a few species are met with in the Mediterranean, 
or the Red Sea. We mention here the genera Crassatella, Tri- 
dacna, Hippopus, Malleus, Avicula, Meleagrina, Spondylus (and 
the genus Plicatula united with it), Vulsella, Placuna. The fre- 
quent occurrence of well-preserved remains of this class in differ- 
ent mountain-strata affords an assistance of the highest interest to 
the investigations of geologists towards a true knowledge and 
distinction of those strata. Of some genera the extinct species are 
much more numerous than those now living ; some genera which 
formerly peopled the sea have entirely disappeared in the present 
period of the history of the earth. It is remarkable that of the 
genera now living and which also count extinct species, whenever 
these last are very numerous, by far the most of the living species are 
now met with either exclusively, or principally, in the Indian ocean 
and in the southern Pacific. Of the genus Trigonia, a single living 
species alone is now known, and this is found in the South Sea at 
New Holland, whilst numerous fossil species belong to it, especially 
from the Jura- and chalk-formations. The genera Spondylus, Lima, 
Avicula, Crassatella, Area and others, tend also to prove the same. 

Regarding the fresh-water conchifers, we would call attention 
to the great number of species of the genus Umo, which occur in 
the western hemisphere, especially in North America. 

The Brachiopoda in their geological and geographical distribu- 
tion offer much that is peculiar. Of Orbicula and Terebratula 
species occur both in the north and in the south ; species are known 
from the Indian ocean and from the Mediterranean, from the South 
Sea on the west coast of America, and from the North Sea. At 
the same time of these genera the species in the southern seas are 
more numerous, and the few species of Lingula are all from the 
southern hemisphere. Extinct species of Terebratula are uncom- 
monly numerous, and occur in very old as well as in more recent 
formations. Thus the Brachiopoda make one of the few forms 
which are restricted to no limited period of the history of the 
earth, and have survived its various catastrophes.

Fossil Brachiopoda by DAVIDSON. Printed for the Palaeontographical 
Soc. 1854, pp. 422. 

The chief characteristic of this division consists in the respira- 
tory organs. In Ligula, on each lobe of the mantle on the inside, 
two main trunks are seen that run longitudinally and return the 
blood to the heart, which is double, as we have seen above, at the 
part where the two are most remote, and converge obliquely to the 
free margin of the lobe of the mantle in the form of an inverted Y. 
Lateral and parallel branches, that make a right angle with the 
trunk, form an elegant pectinated design on the laminae of the 
mantle. It is these vascular divisions which compose the respiratory 
organs ; the gills are, therefore, attached to the mantle, or rather the 
mantle itself is the seat of respiration. From this disposition that 
which presents itself in Orbicula and Terebratula differs more in 
appearance than in reality. The respiratory function is not limited 
here, as in Ligula, to a part of the mantle, but is distributed over 
the whole of it, whilst two vascular stems on one lobe and four on 
the other are formed from numerous branches, and bring back the 
arterial blood to the double heart (OwEN Transact. Zool. Soc. i. 
pp. 147, 148, 154). The two hearts do not receive the blood 
immediately, however, in these molluscs, from the stems of the 
branchial veins, but these last pour it into a sinus, from which it is 
taken up by the free and wide opening of the two auricles of the 
heart (Ann. des Sc. Nat. 3ieme Serie, in. pp. 316319). 

A second character of this order is afforded by the two so-named 
arms, which lie rolled up with their convex side outwards near the 
mouth, and are margined with cirri or filaments. In Terebratula, 
where these filaments are long and fine, these two arms thus acquire 
the external appearance of gills, and have accordingly been so named 
by earlier writers, ex. gr. PALLAS Miscell. Zool. 1766, p. 182, 



CONCHIFERA. 721 

GRUNDLER Naturforscher, n. 1774, pp. 82, 83. The arms have 
in their axis a tendinous canal closed at the extremities, which, 
according to OWEN, is filled internally with a fluid. Muscular fibres 
which surround the canal force, in his opinion, this fluid to the outer 
extremity, and thus cause the arms to unfold. 

In the third place the Brachiopoda are characterised by the 
absence of an elastic ligament, which in the Lamellibranchiates 
exists at the hinge of the shells and works antagonistically with the 
adductor muscles. Thus the shell is opened here by the arms, 
or also, in Terebratula, by the elasticity of a composite apparatus of 
thin calcareous loops which are attached within, to the surface of 
the lesser imperforate shell. Hence arises a more complex dispo- 
sition of the muscular system, which is formed of different oblique 
bundles in place of the single or double adductor muscle found in 
the Lamellibranchiates.

[The Terebratulidce have been subdivided, in the interest of Geology, 
into genera and sub-genera, chiefly according to the extent and form 
of the calcareous appendage. In the true Terebratula the appendage, 
variable in length, is formed of two riband-shaped lamellae fixed to 
the crural base alone, and more or less folded back upon itself.

The shells are usually much extended in the breadth, as, Spirifer spe-

All the species belong to the older, in great part to the transition-forma-

found, Spirifer Walcottii, which is thus met with no more amongst the 
remains of living creatures.

ORDER II. Lamellibranchiata. 

Body compressed, covered on both sides by a lamina of the 
mantle. Branchiae at the sides of the body placed under each lobe

of mantle, mostly lamellose, two on each side, more rarely pectinate, 
composed of thin fimbrise or lacinige crowded together. Four lamelli- 
form tentacles in by far the most, oval or triangular, placed in pairs 
at the sides of mouth. Two lateral shells incumbent on mantle, 
conjoined by an elastic ligament at the back. 

On the internal structure of these lamellibranchiate conchifers, 
what was needful has been already said above. The beard-threads, 
named byssus, still require a short notice. At the foot of the 
conchifers (see above, p. 717) there is often situated a bundle of hairs 
or filaments to which the name of byssus has been given ; sometimes 
these filaments are united into a common mass ; they are attached 
in a cavity at the base of the foot by a peculiar substance secreted 
there (conjunctive matter). From the cavity a furrow runs to 
nearly the extremity of the foot, and along this furrow is situated 
the glandular tissue by which the byssus is secreted. REAUMUR 
maintained that these horny threads were spun just like the web of 
caterpillars and the nets of spiders. With the assistance of the 
muscular foot these threads are directed to determinate situations 
and caused to adhere there firmly by their broad disciforrn extremi- 
ties ; they grow again if cut off. 

Comp. A. MUELLER de Bysso Acephalorum Acced. Tab. n. Berolini, 
1836, 4to, and in WIEGMANN'S Archiv, 1837, s. \ 39, Tab. I. 11. Various 
opinions of writers on these filaments were noticed in the first edition of 
this Handbook, 11. biz. 37. 

Several conchifers, which are not attached by byssus-fil&ments, 
grow fast by one of the two valves to rocks or different substances 
found in the sea. That some of them move freely and get over the 
ground with their foot has been already noticed (p. 717). The two 
valves of the shell are separated from each other by the elastic 
ligament situated at the hinge behind the point (p. 682). White 
compact muscular fibres, which run transversely from one valve to 
the other, close the shell on the other hand. These bundles leave 
impressions on the interior of the shell, two on each valve, the one 
before, the other behind, if, as in most of these animals, two adductor 
muscles be present ; if, on the contrary, as in the oyster, there be 
only one, then only a single muscular impression is to be seen on 
each valve, situated nearly in the middle. 

POLI made many experiments with regard to the force of these muscles 
in living conchifers. Thus he states, for instance, that the adductor muscles 
in the animal of the Noah's shell (Pectunculus) can overcome the resistance 
of 5olbs., and that more than 7olbs. are required to tear them asunder. 
The shell weighed only one pound, the animal itself only 4 ounces. 



CONCHIFERA. 725 

A. Monomyaria. Muscular impression single, subcentral. In- 
ternal ligament received in a cardinal pit, partially visible on the 
outside in some, mostly included. 

The single adductor muscle here corresponds to the posterior adductor of 
those conchifers that have two of them. All the single-muscled conchifers 
live in the sea. 

Family II. Ostracea. Mantle open. Foot none or a small 
rudiment of foot, not byssiferous. Shell irregular, lamellose. 

Anomia BRUG. (Species of genus Anomia L.). Shell inequi- 
valve, thin, one valve flat, perforate or emarginate towards the 
point, the other larger, more gibbous at the base. Animal (Echion 
POLI) with foot small, tentacles at mouth none, margin of mantle 
cirriferous, adhering to marine bodies by a muscular cord perforat- 
ing the shell and inserted into the calcareous cover. 

The name Anomia was first employed by F. COLUMNA (DePurpura, 
Komse, 1616) and given to those conchifera which are now named 
Terebratula. LINNAEUS united with these some very different con- 
chifers also under the name of Anomia, although what he says in the 
description of the characters of this animal (Sys. Nat., ed.12, i. p. 1 150) 
applies to Terebratula alone. JSRUGUiURE^JZncycl.meth., Vers. I. p. 70) 
was the first who gave the name of Anomia to the present genus 
and placed it in the neighbourhood of the oysters. From these, 
however, it differs by many essential characters, so that DESHAYES 
has placed it even in a separate family. There are properly three 
muscles of which the impressions are seen on the convex valve, but 
on the flat valve only a singular muscular impression appears. This 
impression is that of the muscle which corresponds with the central 
depressor of the oyster ; the two other muscles, which are attached 
to the convex valve, go through the aperture of the flat valve and 
fix themselves to the calcareous cover, which is often very hard, 
whence it is named by several writers a little bone (ossiculum). By 
that cover the shell is attached to other conchifera or to rocks. See 
DESHAYES Diet. Univ. d'Hist. Nat. i. 1841, pp.557 559, and the

xrv. PI. 2022, 23, figa. i, 2. In the mount of St Peter is found Ostrca 
larva of which the elongated crooked shell with folded margins has some 
resemblance to the larva of an insect. 

In some species the inferior shell, when the individuals are older, is 
curved upwards at the point and very thick. Of these LAMARCK formed 
his genus Gryphcea. (Sp. Gryphcea angulata LAM. from the coast of Peru.) 
These forms in the fossil state especially abound in the Oolite and Lias 
formations (as Gryphcea arcuata LAM., BLAINV. Malac. PL 59, fig. 4, 
BRONN Lethcea, Tab. 19, figs, i a, I}; hence the name Gryphite-limestone, 
in geological works. In Exogyra SAY, Sow. the point is not bent upwards, 
but sideways. Species of this form occur especially in the chalk- formations.

tentaculate, often ocelliferous. Foot small. Shell regular or sub- 
regular, solid, often marked by longitudinal ribs, mostly auriculate. 

Spondylus L. Shell inequivalve, adherent, mostly auriculate, 
rude or muricate. Hinge with two strong teeth in each valve and

Foot conical, sulcate, mostly byssiferous. Ligament internal, often

We transfer also to this group the genus Vulsdla, as was done by 
DESHAYES, who on the other hand removed Avicula from it, which 
genus we with LAMARCK leave in this family. The characters of the 
group are not yet sufficiently determined, for the animals of these 
shells are hitherto only imperfectly or not at all known. Some 
genera exist only in the fossil state. 

Inoceramus SOWERBY. Shell inequivalve, with points approxi-

for the reception of the divided ligament. (Fossil genus.) 

Many fossil species, especially from the Chalk-period, are contained in 
this genus, whilst none from the tertiary formations are known. DESHAYES, 
as also GOLDFUSS and BRONN, now unite the genera Catillus and Myti- 
lo'ides of BRONGNIART with this. Compare the article Inocerame of DES-

The shell is sometimes four-cornered, with round margin, greenish-brown 
striped with white spots, nacreous within, yellow or blueish white. This 
conchifer produces the finest pearls, and is found in the Persian gulf and 
in the Indian ocean at Ceylon and Borneo, in the straits of Malacca, 
&c. The largest pearls are found in the deepest places, as in the Persian 
gulf near the island Kharrak, where they lie on very deep banks. The 
Persian pearls are hard, and consequently more esteemed than those of 
Ceylon, which are often subject to desquamation.

Pinna L. Shell fragile, thin, often imbricato-squamose, elongate, 
triangular, angustate towards the points. Hinge edentulous ; liga- 
ment marginal. Animal ( Chimcera POLI) with foot vermicular, 
subulate, transversely rugose, delivering at its base the byssus 
of long, dense, silken filaments. Anterior adductor muscle near the 
apices, posterior larger, subcentral. A conical contractile appendage 
at the posterior part of mantle (trachea POLI). 

The shells are large, triangular, thin, and very small at the point ; along 
each shell there runs lengthwise a keel-shaped eminence sometimes feeble, 
for each is formed of two surfaces that meet at an obtuse angle. The 
animal penetrates the sand with the point of the shell, and fastens itself 
above it by the byssus to other objects. The silky byssus-threads of species 
from the Mediterranean are used in Calabria and Sicily as guards for 
gloves, stockings, purses, &c.

and, after the epidermis has been removed, purplish-blue. This species is 
found in the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Mussels grow quickly, 
and are already edible in the second year. Sometimes they are injurious, 
and in the spring with us they are less pleasant to the taste ; as experience 
in Zealand has taught, they are best from July to January. Some con- 
stitutions cannot endure mussels, and this has in part contributed to give 
these conchifers a bad name, as though they were sometimes poisonous. 
The eggs are not taken up by the gills, as in Anodonta and Unio, but by 
the mantle. Compare for the anatomy of the mussel A. DE HEIDE Ana-

it does not agree (Ann. Acad. Lugd. Bat. 1826, 1827, Comment, de Moll,

BENEDEN has given a further account of this animal in Ann. des Sc. nat.,

Baiae, an entire segment is seen, which is perforated by these animals, about 22 feet 
above the surface of the sea; see POLI Test. utr. Sic. II. p. 216; recent geology has 
borrowed a proof from this of the depression and upheaving of the ground from which 
so many phenomena receive their explanation. Compare the well-known work of 
LYELL Principles of Geology.

resembles that of Peclunculus. This genus, which has filiform gills, might 
be left in the preceding family. Of late years many species have become 
known, especially through the English voyager GUMMING. They are all 
small conchifers. 

Trigonia BRUG. Shell trigonal, sometimes suborbicular. Car-

This family contains fresh-water conchifers. LINNAEUS united the 
species known to him partly with Mya, partly with Mytilus. They 
might perhaps be all united in one large genus Unio. 



CONCHIFERA. 735 

Phalanx I. Shell regular, free, with points approximate. 

Unio BRUG. Animal (Limncea POLI) with mantle cloven, con- 
crete posteriorly by a commissure about the anus, surrounding the 
anus with a trachea like an aperture. Posterior margin of each 
lobe of mantle furnished with cirri or tentacles. Branchiae of each 
side coalesced behind the foot. Shell thick, pearly within, with 
points most frequently decorticate. Hinge mostly with two teeth 
in each valve, the anterior thick, obliquely striated, the posterior 
compressed like a lamella, elongate, sometimes obsolete. (Teeth 
of left valve bipartite by a groove for receiving the teeth of the op- 
posite valve.) 

This genus is very numerous in species, especially in North America. 
The knowledge of these species is attended with great difficulties, since the 
naturalists who have described them have dispersed their descriptions, 
partly in Magazines, which are entirely unknown in Europe, and at the 
same time have paid little regard to the contemporary or previous labours 
of one another. We mention here only, as the most accessible, the papers 
of KAFINESQUE (Ann. des Sc. physiques de MM. BORY DE ST. VINCENT et 
DRAPIEZ, v. pp. 287 and foil.), J. LEA (Americ. Philos. Transact., new 
Series, in. Philadelphia, 1828, pp. 259263; in. Pt. 2, 1830, pp. 403 
457, IV. Pt. i, pp. 63 121), and the memoir of DE FERUSSAC, in great part 
bibliographical, in GUERIN'S Magasin de Zoologie, 1835, in which the 
descriptions of TH. SAY and others are cited. 

The form of the numerous shells of this class is very different. For some 
of the forms distinct genera have been adopted. Thus LAMARCK distin- 
guishes the species with a triangular shell and transverse striae on the teeth 
of the hinge, by the name of Castalia (Sp. Castalia ambigua LAM., BLAINV., 
Malacol. PL 67, fig. 4, from S. America). The species that have an oblique 
shell, and at the posterior margin present a large, flat, triangular pro- 
longation, he unites under the genus Hyria. (Sp. Unio syrmatopliorm O. 
FABR. 1 , Hyria avicularis LAM., Mya syrmatophora GRONOV. Zoophylac. 
Tab. xvin. fig. i, Unio corrugatus BLAINV., Malacol. PI. 67, fig. i ; Hyria 
corrugata LAM., Encycl. meih., Vers. PI. 247, fig. 2.) The other species 
LAMARCK leaves together under the genus Unio. But besides Castalia and 
Hyria great varieties of form are found, of which sub-genera might be 
made, as Unio orbiculatus HILDR. or Unio subrotundus RAFIN. of a round 
form 2 , Unio arcceformis LEA, with a flat broad surface behind the points, 
&c. In European species the shell is usually less different in form, elongate, 
forwards round and obtuse, backwards pointed and prolonged.

River-mussel. This genus differs from the preceding in the greater thin- 
ness of the shell, and especially by the absence of hinge, but the animal is 
entirely the same as in the genus Unio, with which too DESHAYES unites it. 
In the shell also Unio dcpressa V. MUEHLFIELD (PFEIFFER 1. 1. n. s. 32, 
33, Tab. vili. figs. 3, 4) forms the transition to Anodonta. The species of 
Anodonta are much less numerous, and exhibit fewer varieties in the form 
of the shell, than those of Unio.

LAMARCK, who first made this genus known, thought that it was found 
in the sea. It was placed in the neighbourhood of the Oysters, from which, 
however, the shell differs by the two muscular impressions. Since that 
time these conchifers were found in the Nile by the traveller CAILLAUD. 
The animal was afterwards described and figured by RANG and QUOT. It 
agrees, as RANG remarks, with that of Unio and Anodonta, so that in fact 
the Etherice might be shortly characterised as irregular Anodonta with one 
of the two shells attached.

the genus Hippurites (placed by LAMARCK amongst the Cephalopoda) 
should be united (Ann. des Sc. nat. v. 1825, p. 205, xv. pp. 258 
266) seem, when the genera Crania and Calceola, belonging to the 
Brachiopoda have been separated from them, to be allied to the 
Chamacea; they had probably, however, an entirely open mantle, 
like the JZtheriacea, Ostreacea &c. (DESHAYES Encycl. meth., Vers. 
in. p. 918). The Hippurites, large, elongate, conical shells, resem- 
bling in some degree, as to external form, the horns of mammals, 
were first discovered at the foot of the Pyrenees by PICOT LA 
PEYROUSE. GOLDFUSS, however, and D'ORBIGNY also, is of opinion 
that these Rudistce belong to the Brachiopoda and by no means 
to the Lamellibranchiata (Ann. des Sc. nat., sec. Serie, xvm. 1842, 
pp. 173 192), in which they now find many supporters.

Family XI. Tridacnacea. Mantle with lobes for the greatest 
part concrete in the margin, furnished with a superior aperture for 
the passage of foot, and two small inferior, the anterior anal, the 
posterior respiratory. Four tentacles round the mouth elongate, 
acuminate. Foot thick. Ligament external, narrow. Two adduc- 
tor muscles approximate or confluent ; muscular impression single, 
little distinct. Shell regular, equivalve, free. 

CUVIER (Regne Anim. n. 1817, p. 475) remarked that in the 
conchifers of this family there is only a single adductor muscle. 
Consequently LAMARCK placed the genus Tridacna subsequently in 
the division of the Monomyaria, with which, however, it does not 
agree. From the figures of the animal of Tridacna mutica given 
by QUOY and GAIMARD in the narrative of the voyage of the Astro- 
labe (copied in Cuv. R. Ani., ed. ill., Moll. PI. 96, fig. 3) it seems 
that two muscles are present however, which lie close together, and, 
although in other species they are confluent and form a single 
muscle, this is no reason for separating Tridacna from those families 
with which in other respects this genus has most agreement.

also occurs in the Indian Ocean ; it is the largest conchifer known. For- 
merly it was the custom to ornament gardens with them as basins of foun- 
tains ; in churches these shells sometimes serve for holding the holy- water, 
as two very large ones may be seen in St Sulpice at Paris; hence the 
derivation of the French name benitier for this species of shell. LINNAEUS 
records a shell of this kind in the Museum Ludovicce Ulricce, that weighs 
532 pounds. In Tridacna the opening of the lunula in older individuals is 
smaller, so that the difference between Hippopus and Tridacna is not very 
essential. 

Family XII. Cardiacea. Mantle with lobes concrete posteriorly, 
open anteriorly for the passage of foot ; two very short tracheae dis- 
tinct, foraminiform, with margin girdled by cirri. Foot large, falci- 
form, not byssiferous. Ligament external. Shell regular, equivalve, 
free. Hinge with two teeth under the point, receiving each 
other by mutual insertion, and one or two lateral. Two muscular 
impressions remote. 

Cardium L. Shell subequilateral, shorter posteriorly, more 
gibbous anteriorly, mostly furnished with longitudinal ribs. Four 
teeth in each valve ; with two oblique under the points, receiving 
each other crosswise by mutual insertion, and two lateral remote, 
compressed. Animal ( Cerastes POLI) with foot falciform, very long, 
serving for jumping.

1 The species belonging to the genus Venus (Venus and Cytherea LAM.) are so 
numerous, that they make up nearly of all the known lamellibranchiata, so that this 
genus much surpasses the genera Tellina, Cardium, Area, Ostrea and Pecten so rich 
in species.

fig. 3. The Venus islandica of BEOCCHI (and Cyprina gigas LAM.) a fossil 
species from the calcaire grassier and other tertiary strata, does not belong

Family XIV. Cycladea. Mantle concrete posteriorly, fur- 
nished with two trachese. Ligament internal. Foot large, not 
byssiferous. Shell equivalve, free, gibbous or ventricose. Hinge 
with teeth under the point various, sometimes obsolete, and 
with lateral teeth gone. Two muscular impressions remote. 

This small family contains conchifers that live in rivers and 
in fresh-water lakes, like the Ndidea, from which it sufficiently 
differs, although Iridina (see above, p. 736), on account of the 
united mantle and the two trachea might be brought to it. The 
present family is nearly allied to the preceding, whose place they 
represent in fresh water. 

Glauconome GKAY. Cardinal teeth three, with middle one larger, 
often bifid. Shell elongate, transverse, with points eroded. 

Fresh-water bivalves, which in external appearance almost resemble 
Anodonta or Unio. They are all exotic. It seems that some fossil fresh- 
water shells, which previously had been referred to the genus Venus, find 
their true place here. 

Galathea BRUG., LAM., Potamophila Sow. Shell trigonal, sub-

small triangular median pit receiving the third intermediate tooth

further distinguishes the genus Pisidium, by the absence of long trachea;, 
which in the animal of these species are short and grown together. Sp.

Family XV. Lucinacea. Mantle open anteriorly, concrete 
posteriorly, and furnished with branchial aperture and single anal 
trachea, or produced into two tracheae connate 'from the base 
throughout. Foot cylindrical, elongate, often vermiform. Liga- 
ment external or subinternal concealed between the exsert margins 
of fissure. Two muscular impressions remote, large, with anterior

with two teeth under the point, and one or two lateral teeth. 

Cyreno'ida JOANNIS, Cyrenella DESHAYES. Shell ventricose,

a few species, all exotic, from fresh water. According to DESHAYES Cyre- 
nella is a fresh-water Lucina, according to DE JOANNIS, a Cyrena without 
lateral teeth at the hinge of the shell. At all events, this genus is inter- 
mediate between this and the preceding family, 

Lucina BRUG. Shell orbiculate, transversely striated, subequi-

4 ; Indian Sea. This shell is finely striated longitudinally between grooves 
running parallel to the margin. Hence the French name la Tricotee or la 
Corbeille, of which last the generic name Corbis is a translation. There are 
fossil species of this genus which are as finely or even more finely treliced. 

Family XVI. Saxicavina (or LitJwpJiaga}. Lobes of mantle 
as to the greater part concrete, with aperture narrow, anterior, emit- 
ting the small foot. Tracheae two, coalesced at the base, tentacu- 
late at the opening. Shell transverse, inequilateral, posteriorly 
elongate, gaping. Ligament external. Two muscular impressions 
remote. Impression of mantle deeply sinuate posteriorly. (Animals 
living in stones, hence the form of shell often irregular.) 

This small family is connected with the genus Venus on the one hand, 
and with Gastrochcena on the other ; perhaps the genus Saxicava might be 
placed in the last family. They are marine conchifers like all the following 
families. 

Petricola LAM. (and Venerupis ejusd.) Hinge with two teeth 
in each valve, sometimes with three. Branchia3 unequal, external 
smaller. 

Venerupis LAM. Tracheae separate at the apex alone. Hinge 
with three teeth in one valve, sometimes in both.

long. Foot triangular, compressed. Shell transverse, equivalve, 
inequilateral, with posterior part often shorter. Ligament external. 
Two muscular impressions remote. Impression of mantle sinuate 
posteriorly. 

That margin of the shell which is ordinarily the longest, is here often the 
shortest, the hindmost, namely, or that where the ligament is situated. It 
was an error, therefore, in LAMARCK to suppose that in Donax the liga- 
ment is displaced, and lies on the lunula; it lies, as in all bivalve shells, 
behind the point. 

Donax L. Shell transverse, posteriorly obtuse, flat. Cardi- 
nal teeth two either in both valves or in left, a single tooth bipar- 
tite in right ; lateral tooth single or two lateral teeth, subremote, 
sometimes obsolete. Ligament short. Animal (Peroncea POLI)

with foot large, lanceolate and margin of mantle cirrate with long 
unequal tracheae, hiding deep under the sand.

anterior part of the animal like a ring. Animal inhabiting a cylin- 
drical tube covered with calcareous substance, and adhering to it 
|by two calcareous pinnae (palmulce) placed at the base of tracheae. 

Pile-worm. These animals live in wood, which they perforate in all 
directions. The cavity in which they reside is covered with a calcareous 
incrustation, but the true shell is bivalve and much smaller than the 
mantle. How they penetrate and bore through the wood is not yet 
sufficiently explained. They grow in the wood, and do not first enter 
it as adult animals, for the external aperture, towards which the two 
tubes (trackece) are turned, is too narrow to allow the inclosed animal 
to enter, however it may have been able to make itself a way at an earlier 
period. 

LINNAEUS placed this genus incorrectly between Serpula and Sdbella 
(amongst the ringed worms), and named the bivalve shell the jaws of the 
animal. He united all the individuals that had been described up to 
his time under one species, Teredo navalis, which is a collective name. 
The species even now are far from being sufficiently distinguished. See 
SPENGLER Skrivter of Naturh. Selskdbet, 11. i. Kjobenhavn, 1792, pp. 99 
1 06, and QUATREFAGES Mem. sur le genre Taret, Ann. des Sc. nat. 
3ieme Se'rie, Tom. XI. 1849, Zoologie, pp. 19 73, PI. I. II. The ana- 
tomical investigations of the writer named last, are the latest and the most 
complete : of the internal structure, to say nothing of older writers, notices 
in modern times have also been given by DESHAYES, in the Exploration 
scientifique de VAlgerie (1846), and FREY und LEUCKART (Beitrdge zur 

482 



756 CLASS xir. 

Kenntniss wirbelloser Thiere, Braunschw. 1847, 4to, s. 4653). They are, 
according to QUATREFAGES, of distinct sex, but the male individuals are 
much rarer than the female. 

For the distinction of species recourse is had amongst other characters to 
the form of the two small shovel-shaped calcareous plates which are placed 
below on the mantle, at the base of the tracheae, and are commonly named 
palmulce. One species, famous for the injury it caused to the piles of the 
dykes in Holland, in the beginning of the last century especially, might be 
named Teredo Sellii (Teredo navalis L. et auctor. in part, Teredo batavus 
SPENGLER). It is figured in the work of SELLIUS and in BLUMENBACH 
Abh. naturhistorischer Gegenstdnde, No. 89. The palmulce are fixed on a 
short pedicle, inversely triangular, and terminating at the broad end on 
each side in a point. Piles that had been driven only six or seven weeks 
previously were seen to be entirely eaten through by this worm, and robbed 
of all their strength. In this way the island of Walcheren was in 1730 
threatened with destruction. From time to time the same mischief was 
discovered in other places, especially on the Zuiderzee near Medemblik, 
Lambertshagen, &c. ; West-Friesland was forced in consequence to mask 
its dykes with large stones, which being brought into the country from 
abroad, occasioned a great expense; according to MARTINET, Catechismus 
der Natuur. in. bl. 33, f. 5,600,000 were applied to the first repair of these 
dykes. Since the middle of the last century the mischief has much diminished, 
so that hence may be explained the fact, that even in the national museums 
only a few specimens of Teredo are preserved. This injury to our dykes 
was the occasion of many writings, which however contributed little to 
the advancement of science. We suffice ourselves with citing the large 
work of G. SELLIUS, Histor. nat. Teredinis. Traj. ad Ehen. 4to. Fossil 
Teredines also are found in the tertiary formations and in the chalk strata.

calcareous pipes. The description of RUMPHIUS already indicates that the 
enclosed animal has much agreement with Teredo. This was confirmed by 
the discovery of a similar species in the Mediterranean a few years ago by 
MATHERON (Septaria mediterranea DESH. ConcTiyl. PI. i, figs. 9, 10). The 
animal with its small shell is contained in the tube that sticks in the 
sand. Perhaps this genus might be united with Teredo, as has been the 
Indian species figured by HOME under the name of Teredo giganteus (Phil. 
Transact. 1806).

stony polyparies ; in these the calcareous tube was seen above the head, 
and they were separated from the preceding as a distinct genus (Gastro- 
chcena LAM.). [The name Chccna substituted for Gastrochcena by A. J.

CLASS XIII. 
MOLLUSCS (MOLL USC A). 

ALTHOUGH the name Molluscs has a more general signification, 
and is also so used by us in this work, yet we prefer employing it 
in a more limited sense for a class of animals which, in the former 
edition of this handbook, we named cephalophorous molluscs. 
Names of classes ought in our judgment to be short and not to be 
confounded with definitions or descriptions. LAMARCK too has 
already given the name of molluscs in the same sense to this divi- 
sion of the animal kingdom. 

The animals of this class have a head more or less distinct 
from the rest of the body. This head usually contains special 
organs of sense for touch and vision, sometimes even for hearing. 
Many of these animals have a shell, others are naked. Most of 
them live in water, but some on land, which in the two classes 
immediately preceding is never the case. However there are 
amongst these animals very different degrees of perfection in the 
organisation, yet we observe the same difference more or less in 
other classes also of invertebrate animals, nay even in the last class 
of vertebrates, that of fishes 1 . Accordingly we must here trace the 
principal differences in the arrangement of organs according to the 
natural groups and families. 

The oral cavity of molluscs forms a very muscular expansion, 
at the base of which lies an organ, usually named tongue, which is 
covered by little teeth or hooks placed in transverse rows. In some 
this tongue is short and broad, in others ribbon-shaped and long 2 . 
Above the tongue is a transverse horny plate with projecting lines

we said above, pp. 34, 35.

LOVEN in Ofversigt af Kongl. Vetensk-ATcademiens ForJiandlingar, 1847, pp. 175 199, 
who has described and figured these teeth in very many genera. That these hard parts 
consist of silex was observed by HANCOCK and EMBLETON in Eolis. Ann. of Nat. Hist. 
xv. 1845, pp. 9, 10. 



MOLLUSCS. 759 

(Helix, Limax), or at the side of it two jaws are found. The 
intestinal canal has various lengths, but is usually tortuous and 
longer than the body ; it is very long, for instance, in Chiton and 
Patella, and makes many convolutions which are straitly enclosed by 
the liver. The oesophagus is sometimes expanded at the lower end 
like a crop, as in Limnceus, Planorbis, Nautilus and Octopus, which 
has longitudinal folds like those usually occurring in the oesopha- 
gus. The stomach is in some, as in Helix, membranous, in others 
muscular. In many this muscular stomach is armed internally 
with hard parts, as in Scyllcea, Sulla, Bullcea, or the inner mem- 
brane is horny, as in Tethys and the Cephalopoda, just as it is in 
gallinaceous birds. There are often found pieces of Crustacea in this 
stomach, whence it may be concluded that a hard covering of this 
kind is serviceable for crushing hard food. In some the stomach 
is compound, as in Onchidium and Aplysia, in which three (or 
in the last named genus, according to CUVIER, even four) stomachs 
are present. The first stomach is here membranous, the second 
muscular, armed internally with larger cartilaginous teeth placed in 
circles alternately, and with a single row of smaller teeth at the 
upper edge ; the third stomach is armed on its inner surface with 
hooks which are curved forwards ; the fourth, finally, is an elongated 
blind sac, which is surrounded by the liver. According to OWEN, 
this blind sac may be a secreting organ, a pancreas in the simplest 
form, corresponding to the coecal appendages at the inferior orifice 
of the stomach in fishes 1 . As such also he regards the so-called 
second stomach in the Cephalopods, a membranous blind appendage 
behind the muscular stomach, which in Sepia and Octopus incloses 
a spiral membranous valve, and in Nautilus is parted into many 
chambers by thin transverse membranous valves 2 . The termina- 
tion of the rectum in molluscs is usually situated on the right 
side of the body, always in the neighbourhood of the respiratory 
organs. 

Salivary glands, which are wanting in the preceding class, 
appear very constantly to be present in this. Commonly there are 



1 Lectures on the compar. Anat. of the invert. Anim. p. 300; sec. ed. p. 557. 

2 In some cephalopods there are folliculi, larger than the liver itself, which are 
attached to the gall-ducts; HUNTER regarded these as pancreas (Physiol. Catalogue I. 
p. 229), in which opinion V. SIEBOLD also participates. Lchrb. dcr vcrgl. Anat. 

s- 393- 



760 CLASS XI II. 

two of them, but in many Cephalopoda and some Gasteropoda, as 
in lanthina, there are four ; in this case the anterior pair is situated 
very close to the mouth. 

The liver is much developed. A gall-bladder is not present in this 
class, and the secretion of bile is not effected from venous but from 
arterial blood. In Helix the liver is divided into four large lobes. 
In Testacella the liver is double, one on each side, whilst there are 
three of them in Onchidium Peronii, each with a distinct gall-duct ; 
two of these ducts implant themselves in the oesophagus, so that 
the bile may act upon the chyme as soon as it is in the stomach. 
In many Cephalopods also the liver is formed of several lobes 
distinct from each other. The colour is yellow-brown or, as in 
Nautilus, dark wine-coloured red. The finer structure of the liver 
consists of numerous blind branched follicles which are covered 
internally by a stratum of bile-forming cells 1 . 

The urinary secretion is not wanting in Molluscs, although it 
has not yet been determined in all of them what organ effects it. 
JACOBSON first observed that in the calcareous sac of Helix and 
Limax, which CuviEtt had named the mucus-secreting organ 2 , uric 
acid is present, and that this part ought to be named the kidney of 
Molluscs 3 . This organ is a sacciform cavity provided internally with 
numerous folds or laminae which is situated near the heart and has 
an efferent duct that terminates close to the respiratory aperture. 
In the Ctenobranchiates, as Murex and JBuccinum, the same is 
described as the organ which secretes the purple fluid, and the duct

appendages of the venous stems are to be regarded as kidneys 4 .

another function, viz. that of introducing water for its admixture 
with the blood. In the Pteropods, in which HUXLEY first observed 
it, GEGENBAUER has shewn that this sac with thick spongy walls, 
always seated within the mantle and in the neighbourhood of the 
heart, communicates on the one hand with the respiratory cavity 
by an aperture provided with circular and longitudinal muscular 
fibres, and on the other with the pericardial sinus by a tubu- 
lar opening, which has a sphincter muscle and cilia at its ex- 
tremity 1 . In the Heteropods it has the same relations with the 
branchial cavity and the pericardial sinus 2 ; except that in Firi- 
loides, which has no respiratory organ, it opens externally on the 
right side of the body near the vent 3 . In the Ctenobranchiata 
LEYDIG has shewn in Paludina vivipara, that the triangular kid- 
ney, situated near the heart, and receiving venous blood on its 
passage to the gill, communicates with a wide space which is at 
once its expanded duct and a sac receiving water from the gill- 
cavity by a minute aperture. The water of this sac contains blood- 
globules, so that a direct communication between the water and 
the blood may be presumed to occur in the substance of the kidney 4 . 
In the Grymnobranchiata, on the other hand, the kidney is de- 
scribed by HANCOCK and EMBLETON as a branched, tubular, 
spongy organ, inextricably connected with the liver on which it 
lies, and opening by a duct near the vent, but presenting no other 
aperture. It receives, according to these writers, blood partly from 
the aorta and partly from a pulsatory sac which delivers its con- 
tents also to the liver. They regard this sac as a portal heart to 
which the pericardial sinus serves as an auricle 5 ; though by others 
it is regarded as the kidney 6 .] 

The heart is constantly arterial, that is, it receives the veins of 
the respiratory organs and gives off the arteries of the body. In

some (Haliotis, Crepidula, &c.) the rectum, as in most of the bi- 
valves, passes through the heart. Usually the veins of the respi- 
ratory organs are collected in a membranous auricle (atrium), to 
whose broader part the broad part of the conical ventricle of the heart 
is attached. In most of the Cephalopods three hearts are present ; 
namely, two lateral hearts that drive the venous blood to the gills, 
and a larger arterial heart placed in the middle, that receives the 
veins of the gills. The blood of molluscs is whitish ; it is brown, 
sometimes green or red in some GymnobrancMata, where the colour 
of the body often depends upon that of the blood 1 . Blood-cor- 
puscles are present in smaller quantity than in vertebrate animals ; 
they are round, in some degree flat and often filled with little 
granules. 

The venous part of the circulating system is always more or less 
imperfect. CUVIER had noticed in Aplysia as early as the beginning 
of this century, that, in place of a vena cava and of branchial arteries, 
spaces are present, which are perforated like meshes and communi- 
cate freely with the cavity for the intestines 2 . This disposition 
was, however, regarded as an exception. Within the last few 
years it first became apparent, especially from the investigations of 
MILNE EDWARDS, that a large part of the circulating system in all 
molluscs is formed by interspaces, which surround the different 
organs of the body and are bounded by no special walls 3 . The 
venous blood bathes the viscera, and is received into the cavity in 
which these are contained, as into a sinus, before being distributed 
to the respiratory organs. The vessels which conduct the blood to 
these organs (the branchial arteries), do not originate in capillaries, 
but have often very conspicuous apertures ; in some the venous sys- 
tem appears to be entirely absent, with the exception of the branchial 
veins which, conveying arterial blood, run to the heart 4 . In some

molluscs the arterial system also is imperfect, especially in the 
nudibranchiates 1 . 

Some molluscs breathe atmospheric air by a cavity rich in 
vessels ; others, and indeed the greatest number breathe, as fishes 
do, the air diffused through water by means of gills. The form of 
the gills is very various, as will be explained in the view of the 
different families in the systematic arrangement. In those that have 
a shell, this is a special protection for the respiratory apparatus, 
and is usually situated, whenever it does not cover the entire animal, 
upon these organs. 

In the organs of propagation in molluscs great variety prevails. 
Some are bisexual, others have distinct sexes. 

In those molluscs in which the sexes are distinct, no external 
difference is on the whole to be observed ; an extremely remarkable 
exception to this is however formed by the genus Argonauta 
amongst the Cephalopods, in which the male individuals have 
hitherto been entirely unrecognised, as will be explained in the 
sequel when we treat of this genus. In some there are no external 
sexual or copulating organs present, and here, as in the bivalves, the 
sexual difference can alone be recognised by microscopic investiga- 
tion of the content of the secreting organs, which has been done 
within the last ten years in Chiton, Patella, and Haliotis (the vydo- 
brancliiata and aspidobranchiata) , which were formerly supposed 
to be all bisexual or rather female 2 . In others, on the contrary, 
a copulation occurs, at least an approximation as in the Cephalo- 
pods. Here there is a penis also, which in Buccinum is of 
unusual size, in the Cephalopods short only. The testis or the 
ovary is single and lies in the Gasteropoda close to the liver. In 
Nautilus the oviduct has a free opening on each side, and thus the 
eggs do not come, as is elsewhere the general rule with invertebrate 
animals, immediately by a closed canal from the ovary. 

Amongst those molluscs which are hermaphrodite, to which, 
besides many Gasteropoda, the Pteropoda belong, the arrangement 
of the sexual apparatus has been best investigated in the genera 
Helix and Limax. In these animals, backwards close to the liver

which the large artery ends freely forwards.

a gland is situated, which consists of many long blind sacs that 
unite digitally, whose branches or roots in consequence unite to 
form a single efferent duct. This duct then runs along the inferior 
extremity of another larger gland, elongate, and often ending like a 
tongue ; this last was regarded by CUVIER as the testis, and the 
smaller compact gland as the ovary. An exactly opposite opinion 
was advanced by TREVIRANUS*, which however was contradicted 
by CARUS, who found eggs in the first-named gland 2 . With this 
other observations again were in conflict which proved the presence 
there of spermatozoa. The matter seemed inexplicable, until its 
time bearing was illustrated by the microscopic investigations of 
H. MECKEL 3 . The gland which CUVIER names ovary, TREVIRA- 
NUS testWj is both one and the other ; it is a double, truly herma- 
phrodite gland ; every folliculus is double, and within the external, 
which contains eggs, an internal is enclosed with seed and sperma- 
tozoa in different states of development. The tongue-shaped organ, 
regarded by CUVIER as testis, is a gland secreting albumen, and 
covering the eggs with its secretion. Hence this organ becomes 
tumid subsequently to copulation, as on the other hand the true 
sexual gland, according to CUVIER the ovary, after the time of 
copulation shrinks up 4 . The penis is a long filiform organ, capable 
of eversion, which in copulation is received within a tube that ter- 
minates at the end in a round vesicle 5 .

6 This vesicle was aleady compared by DESHAYES and PREVOST to the poche copu- 
lative of insects (see above, p. 266). The last writer established by actual observation 
that the penis in Limncei is received at the time of copulation by the pedicle of the 
vesicle. Moreover the pulmonary gasteropod molluscs present an arrangement which 
is not easy to reconcile with the opinions of STEENSTRUP, whose work we alluded to 



MOLLUSCS. 765 

Most molluscs are oviparous; only few, as Paludina vivipara 
and Clausilia ventricosa, are viviparous. Development from the 
egg begins with a cleaving or separating of the yolk, as has been 
already noticed by us in other classes of animals. Presently the 
yolk begins after a longer or shorter period to rotate round an 
axis, which at first occurs more feebly, afterwards more rapidly and 
regularly. With this rotatory motion a progressive one is connected 
by which the yolk describes a circle. These motions are caused 
by cilia. It is to be remarked, that, according to the observations 
of SARS, LOVEN and others, young marine molluscs universally, 
though they be afterwards naked, possess a shell which like that of 
Nautilus is volute and covers the hind part of the body. Also 
these molluscs undergo a remarkable change of form, since, before 
tentacles appear, a large thin membrane, divided into two lobes, 
surrounds the mouth. This part (velum] is surrounded by cilia, and 
is the principal organ of motion. In some molluscs this organ is 
found to be persistent, most conspicuously in Tethis, where the fine 
cilia surrounding the margin are replaced by cirri 1 . 

The power of restoration is in some species of this class very 
great. In various Helices the reproduction of the head that has 
been (partly) excised and of antennae has been observed by SPAL- 
LANZANI, SENEBIER, and BONNET 2 . That the entire head grows 
again, as the experiments of SPALLANZANI appeared to indicate, may 
however be doubted, since the anatomical investigation of such 
snails as had been preserved by this observer in spirit afterwards 
proved that by the excision the first or cerebral ganglion had not 
been removed 3 . 

The nervous system of molluscs presents various degrees of 
development in the different orders and families. It may be re- 
garded as the general type, that there is a central mass above and 



(p. 135), and it is not apparent from his figures why he considers Tab. u. fig. i, to 
represent a female, fig. 2 a male individual of Helix pomatia.

another below the oesophagus, each of which consists of two lateral 
portions, that either remain distinct or are more or less fused 
together to form an over- and an under-lying ganglion. From the 
central nerve-mass situated above the oesophagus, or from the two 
lateral ganglia when these, as in Patella, Halwtis, Bulla, &c., are 
only united by a transverse commissure above the oesophagus, arise 
the nerves of the eyes, of the feelers and of the mouth. On each 
side this brain-like central organ is united with the central mass 
lying under the oesophagus by one or more nervous filaments (in 
Helix by three). The nervous ring, thus formed, surrounds the 
oesophagus, and is in many short, because the central masses are 
situated near the fore part of the body and in the neighbourhood 
of each other ; only in some is this ring very long, as in the Hete- 
ropoda, because the second central mass is situated backwards. In 
many nudibranchiates the central nerve-mass placed above the 
oesophagus is much developed, and that which lies beneath it 
feebly ; in the Ctenobranchiata also the first nerve-ganglion that lies 
over the oesophagus is much larger than the second which lies 
under it. The converse occurs in the Pteropoda, where the upper- 
most or cerebral nerve-center is ordinarily represented by a trans- 
verse commissure alone above the oesophagus. From the central 
nerve-mass, situated below the oesophagus, and consisting of a 
greater or less number of different ganglia, arise the nerves for the 
viscera, the respiratory and generative organs. In some several 
ganglia or nerve-masses remote from each other are present, as in 
Aplysia, where a distinct ganglion is situated backwards at the origin 
of the aorta. The nerve-ganglia are often coloured red, as in the 
genus just referred to, in Limnceus, Planorlis, &c., by a substance 
situated under the neurilema. In various molluscs a nervous sys- 
tem corresponding to that of the visceral nerves of articulate ani- 
mals has also been observed 1 , of which the anterior portion consists 
of small ganglia that lie at the side of the oesophagus, and are con- 
nected by nervous filaments with the cerebral ganglion, whilst back- 
ward, from one or two ganglia, branches are given off to the intes- 
tinal canal, the liver, and the organs of propagation 2 .

2 The nervous system has been described and figured in different Gasteropoda, espe- 
cially by CUVIEB in his Mtmoires pour servir a I" Hist, et d I'Anat. des Mollusques ; see 



MOLLUSCS. 767 

The organs of sense are more developed, as a rule, in this than 
in the two preceding classes. The head is usually furnished (in 
most Gasteropoda) on the upper surface with two feelers, on the 
outer margin of which the eyes, sometimes on two little tubercles 
or pedicles, are situated. When the eye- supporting pedicles are 
developed independently, two pairs of feelers are present. In 
some these feelers are hollow and can be everted like the finger of 
a glove after they have been drawn in, as may be seen in the com- 
mon snail. Besides these feelers situated on the head, different 
productions of the mantle are probably the seat of a finer sense of 
touch, as the cirri round its margin in Patella and Haliotis. The 
folded and indented fringe or circular lip in the Cephalopoda, the 
various feelers round the mouth in Nautilus, may also be regarded 
as organs of tact. 

Taste cannot be very highly developed, since the tongue, as we 
stated above, is horny. Of the organ of smell nothing certain is 
known, although in Nautilus a part, first pointed out by VALEN- 
CIENNES, situated close to the eyes, may probably be regarded as 
such. That, however, many molluscs possess the sense of smell 
seems to be demonstrated by observations; thus SWAMMERDAM 
found that vineyard snails, when he brought fresh food near them, 
came out of their house and crept quickly towards it. According 
to CUVIER the entire mantle that covers these animals may be 
analogous to the pituitary or mucous membrane of the nasal cavities, 
and thus very appropriately the organ of smell 1 . 

The auditory organ was known in the Cephalopods alone a few 
years ago. In the cartilage of the head two small cavities are 
found, which enclose a sacculus filled internally with a fluid, whilst 
it is surrounded also by a fluid substance and attached to the larger 
cavity, in which it is suspended by numerous fibrous threads. In 
this sac, in most species, there lies a calcareous round or conical 
little stone. The auditory nerve penetrates the saccule, and divides 
into fine branches on its inner surface. There are neither apertures.

system of the Cephalopoda see below on this order.

nor other external parts of the auditory organ present 1 . It is only 
within the last ten years that a knowledge has been attained of the 
auditory organs of Pteropods and Gasteropoda ; they are two round 
saccules filled with fluid, each containing a small otolite or nume- 
rous calcareous concrements, and situated on the central nerve-mass 
beneath the oesophagus, or in some behind the eyes, in which case 
they receive a nervous branch from the cerebral ganglion 2 . 

In most molluscs two small eyes are present, in the Cephalo- 
pods alone are they large. They never occur in greater number, 
nor dispersed over other parts of the body, but are always situated 
on or near the head; in some they are non-pediculate and are 
placed at the base of the feeler, or stand on tubercles or sometimes 
at the point of the feeler, as we lately stated. In Nautilus they 
are seated on little pedicles at the side of the head, like hemispheres 
flattened on the anterior surface. In the rest of the Cephalopoda 
they lie in lateral excavations of the cartilaginous ring of the head, 
protected in some degree by two long, thin, oval cartilaginous 
plates in front. In the Gasteropoda, SwAMMERDAM formerly inves- 
tigated the eyes anatomically ; in our century this investigation has 
been repeated and extended, especially by STIEBEL, MUELLER, and 
KROHN. Under the skin, that in this situation is destitute of pig- 
ment, lies the eye-ball, enclosed by a proper membrane (sclerotica) , 
which is transparent in front, and sometimes very convex (cornea). 
The vascular choroid, coloured by a black pigment, is furnished 
with an annular aperture (just as an iris is). A spherical lens and 
a vitreous body occupy the interior of the eye-ball, whilst the optic 
nerve expands within the choroid into a cup-shaped retina 5 .

MOLLUSCS. 769 

In the Cephalopods, the optic nerve is continued into a large 
reniform ganglion, which is surrounded by a white fatty mass 
divided into lobes, and is, with the eye-ball, surrounded by a 
common case, a fibrous membrane, by which a sac is formed, that 
is much larger than the eye-ball, and may be regarded as the cap- 
sule (orbita) of the eye. In front this membrane is attached to the 
common integument. There the skin becomes transparent, and 
sometimes forms, by duplicatures or folds, two eye-lids as it were. 
Behind this transparent membrane, perforated by a round opening, 
the eye-ball is situated. A cornea is not present, and thus also 
there is no anterior chamber, unless the space that intervenes be- 
tween the transparent continuation of the common integument and 
the eye-ball be so named. Within the eye-case lies a tunic of a 
silvery lustre. The eye-ball itself has a cartilaginous external 
membrane, which is perforated behind like a sieve by the filaments 
of the optic nerve, and in front at the margin of the lens forms the 
circle of the pupil. This covering may be regarded as sclerotica. 
Within it lies the expansion of the optic nerve, the retina, which 
also contains a purple-brown pignient-layer. The lens is large, 
elongate, round, and at the posterior surface more convex than in 
front 1 . 

The muscles of molluscs are attached in general to the inner 
surface of the skin. They do not exhibit the transverse stripes on 
the primitive bundles which microscopic anatomy has detected in 
the muscles of articulate animals 2 . Those Gasteropods that have a

small aperture existing in the middle of the flat anterior surface of the eye, appears to 
me probable. Fresh specimens alone can afford a satisfactory solution.

no mollusc. In Cephalopods also I cannot any more than in the muscular circular 
belts of Salpa (p. 695) discover these transverse stripes, though they have been adopted 
indeed in these animals, and also figured.

wreathed shell are affixed to it by a muscle which is attached to 
the uppermost turn near the columella, and descends along the turns 
to attach itself to the head "by one portion, and to the hinder ex- 
tremity of the foot by the other. This muscle, on its contraction, 
serves to draw the snail into its house. 

Gasteropods advance also by creeping on the ventral disc, or 
foot, in which they fix alternately the fore part, then the hind 
part, to the surface over which they are moving, whilst the disc is 
contracted into sinuous transverse grooves that proceed from be- 
fore backwards. Pteropods swim by means of the wing-like ap- 
pendages that surround the mouth. The same purpose is served by 
the flaps of skin on the body of most Cephalopods, which are 
especially assisted when creeping on the bottom of the sea and in 
other motions, as seizing their prey, &c. by the muscular arms, 
furnished with suckers, that surround the head. 

Molluscs, as to their geographical distribution, are not suf- 
ficiently ascertained, and it is difficult to form any general con- 
clusions from comparison, since all countries, coasts, and seas, have 
not been investigated with equal care. Molluscs are more nume- 
rous than conchifers in great seas and on rocky coasts. In warmer 
regions they surpass the bivalves greatly in multiplicity of species. 
The greatest profusion of marine molluscs, as well as to genera as 
species, belongs, beyond doubt, to the great ocean between the 
west coast of America, and the east coast of Asia and New Hol- 
land. Tropical forms seem to extend more widely in the southern 
than in the northern hemisphere. Amongst the genera that are 
most numerous in species, we may here mention especially Purpura, 
Mitra, Cyprcea, and Conus / the species of the three last genera are 
almost all from the great ocean, and the East Indian sea. It is 
remarkable that the molluscs on the western and on the eastern 
coast of South America differ to such a degree, that there is scarcely 
a species that is common to both coasts. The genus Chiton, so 
numerous in species in the great ocean, is represented by a couple 
of species on the east coast of America. Species that dwell at con- 
siderable depths are naturally further dispersed than those which 
live more in the neighbourhood of coasts. Consequently it is not 
sufficient to ascertain the longitude and latitude of the districts 
within which certain species occur ; the depth also of the sea ought 
to be ascertained in which they commonly live. With the depth

the number of species decreases, just as that of land animals does 
the greater the height is above the surface of the sea. Amongst 
the Cephalopods that have a shell, and which occur sparingly in 
the present creation, whilst in the previous world they were very 
numerous and different in form, Nautilus is confined entirely to the 
Indian and South Seas. Of the molluscs that live on land, no 
genus is more generally diffused than Helix, of which some 
hundreds of species are known, and which occurs in all regions. 
The species of molluscs are in a greater degree than those of 
bivalves confined to limited regions, and thus, on the whole, differ 
more in different countries 1 . 



1 Interesting contributions to the knowledge of the geographical distribution of 
molluscs have been made in the last few years by the investigations of SABS, FORBES, 
D'ORBIGNY, PHILIPPI and others. Compare A. D'ORBIGNY RecJiercJies sur les lois qui

SYSTEMATIC 
ARRANGEMENT OF MOLLUSCS, 



CLASS XIII. 
MOLLUSCA. 

ANIMALS covered by a soft moist skin, mostly forming over the 
back a duplicature, free at the margin (mantle). Head more or less 
distinct, furnished with tentacles and often with two eyes. Shell 
calcareous, mostly univalve, in some multivalve, never bivalve ; in 
a few internal, in some absent. Organs of circulation and respi- 
ration mostly distinct; heart always aortic. A nervous ring around 
the oesophagus ; nerves proceeding from ganglia, various in number, 
towards the peripheral parts of the body. 

Many aquatile, some 'terrestrial, almost all swimming or 
creeping. 

ORDER I. Pteropoda. 

Molluscs furnished at the anterior part on both sides with a 
natatory expansion or pinna, with head often little distinct, herma- 
phrodite, marine. 

Wing-footed. CUVIER first distinguished this division under this 
name in 1804. He characterised it by the absence of the foot or the 
ventral disc ; this part, however, appears to be not so entirely want- 
ing, though formed in a different fashion, especially laterally, and to 
be developed into the so-named wings or fins. Hence some writers, 
and amongst them SOULEYET, unite the Pteropoda with the Gastero- 
poda. At all events they have a closer alliance with these than 
with the Cephalopoda, and must, on account of the simplicity of 
structure, be placed below the Gasteropoda.

Family I. Hyaleacea. Pteropods with head indistinct, included 
posteriorly in a thin shell. 

Hyalea LAM. (Cavolina GlOENI, ABILDGAARD, Caulina POLI). 
Shell thin, pellucid, flat above, convex beneath, cloven on both 
sides. Two large pinnae at the sides of mouth. Mantle produced 
on both sides between the fissures of shell, with contractile appen- 
dages. Branchiae arranged in a circle round the other viscera, 
fasciculate. 

[In this family, the mantle, besides forming the general covering 
for most of the viscera, is inflected anteriorly on the ventral surface 
to form a pocket, which is the branchial cavity. The mantle sends 
processes laterally through the fissures of the shell in Hyalece, two 
large laminae on each side, which meeting in the middle, cover the 
dorsal and ventral surfaces of the shell. Whilst the animal is alive 
this is their constant position, but when it dies they are retracted 
within the shell, and hence were not known until observed by 
GECENBAUER. Besides these lamellae there are contractile processes 
in Hyalece often six times the length of the body. They are fre- 
quently mutilated. All the different processes are less developed 
in Cleodora and Creseis, and none of them are thrown round the 
shell. A lobe that joins the pinnae at their base represents the foot 
in this family. See GEGENBAUER 1. 1. s. 4, 5.]

Spiratella BLAINV., Limacina Cuv. Body anteriorly auriculate 
on both sides with a triangular pinna, posteriorly convolute. Shell 
fragile, discoidal, on one side deeply umbilicate, on the other with a 
spire slightly exsert.

in the North Polar Sea, and serves the whale for food ; see O. FABKICIUS 
Faun. Groenl. pp. 387 389, by which writer it is named Argonauta arc- 
tica. In PHIPPS'S Voyage towards the N. Pole it is noticed under the name 
of Clio helicina, and it is probable that CUVIER intended to name it Heli- 
cina, a name which we should prefer to that of Limacina which perhaps 
originated merely in a mistake. 

Cymbulia PERON. Animal included in shell, except two large 
pinnae, confluent [partially, with a middle lobe that represents the 
foot. GEGENB.]. Two contractile tentacles in front of mouth. 
Shell hyaline, elongate, cymbiform, truncated posteriorly.

a thin lamella of the same. This last is easily torn and thus perfect speci- 
mens are rare : hence also the ease with which the animal loses its shell. 
The shell has the consistence of soft cartilage and contains chitin. GEGEN-

[Tiedemannia DELLE CHIAJE. Pinnae conjoined with the foot 
to form an orbicular disc. - Mouth at the apex of a long proboscis, 
very often bent backwards. Shell hyaline, gelatinous, slightly 
excavated.

and appears to differ from that figured by QUOY and GAIMARD in the 
voyage of the Astrolabe (copied in Cuv. R. ani., ed. ill, Mollusq. PI. 17, 
fig. 2), where the suckers stand like branches on two pedicles. Pneumo- 
dermon violaceum D'ORBIGNY has a greater resemblance to it, the anatomy 
of which has been given by V. BENEDEN with figures in MUELLER'S ArcUv, 

1838, pp. 296304, PI. IX. X. There is still uncertainty respecting the 
respiratory organs, and the name PNEUMODERMON rests perhaps on a 
mistake. [Pn. ciliatum GEGENB., see the anatomy, &c. 1. 1. s. 74 100. 
The folds of the integument, here absent, which serve for respiration, are 
described in Pn. violaceum and P. Mediterraneum, pp. 85, 86.]

Clio L., Clione PALL., ESCHRICHT. Body oblong, acuminate 
posteriorly. Head distinct from body by stricture, covered by a 
bilobed hood, crowned by six conical appendages, and two retractile 
conical tentacles. Two oval pinnae at the sides of neck. Two 
black points (eyes) in the back of neck. Two genital apertures at 
the right of the ventral side, the anterior in front of pinnse for 
the exit of a very large penis, the posterior behind the pinnse 
for the oviduct. Anus behind these orifices, more in the middle.

separately in German, Anatom. Untersuckungen u. d. Cl. boreal. Kopen- 
hagen, 1838, 4to.) The six conical arms of the head are beset with spots, 
microscopic suckers. This animal (Whale-bait), Clio limacina PHIPPS, 
lives with Clio kelicina principally in the neighbourhood of Greenland and 
Spitzbergen, and forms the chief food of northern whales, although scarcely 
i" long. CUVIER regarded the fin-like appendages as respiratory organs, but 



776 CLASS xiir. 

it was probably the reticulated muscular fibres that he took for vessels 
in these dermal lamellae [Clio Mediterranea GEGENB., tentacles very short, 
no eye-points; Cl. flavescens GEGENB. G. thinks that the 3,000 suckers in 
each tentacle described by ESCHEICHT are merely forms of epithelium.] 

ORDER II. Gasteropoda. 

Molluscs with head distinct, in most tentaculate, the inferior 
surface of abdomen flattened or grooved, or produced into a com- 
pressed lamina. Some hermaphrodite, others distinct in sex ; many 
aquatic, some terrestrial. 

Gasteropoda. In most the heart lies on the left side of the body. 
In those, however, that have left-handed shells (see above, p. 684) 
the heart lies on the right side. In many the sexes are distinct ; 
others are bisexual, so that mutual impregnation of two or some- 
times more individuals occurs. 

The inferior surface of the belly forms an elongate flattened disc, 
which is very muscular, as is commonly known in slugs and snails ; 
these animals, met with everywhere, give an idea of the typus of 
this order. But in others, this ventral disc, usually named foot, is 
compressed laterally, and serves for swimming. We separate these 
molluscs from the rest as a distinct group. 

Family III. A. ffeteropoda. Foot compressed, resembling a 
fin, furnished with a disc or suctorial acetabulum. Branchiae pec- 
tinate or pinnate. Sexes distinct. 

Heteropods. These molluscs all live in the sea, and usually swim 
with the fin-shaped foot upwards, and the back downwards. 
FORSKAL, to whom we owe the first description of this family of 
animals, gave them the name of Pterobranchea. The existence of 
distinct sexes was discovered by LAURILLARD and MILNE EDWARDS. 
[The part named ' Foot' is highly developed in this family, and in 
some attains a high potentiality (GEGENB.). It does not exactly 
correspond to the foot of Gasteropods, but to one part of it alone. 
HCTXLEY (On the Morphology of the Cephalous Mollusca, Phil. 
Trans. 1853, Pt. i. pp. 29 65). A foot has four parts, the pro- 
podium, mesopodium, and metapoditim, found in Heteropods, and a 
fourth, the epipodium, not found in them. The fin-shaped foot of 
heteropods is the propodiwm. Besides the works just referred to, 
comp. also, on this division, LEUCKART Zoologische Untersuchungen, 
Drittes Heft, Giessen, 1854, Der Bau der Heteropoden, pp. 1 68.] 



MOLLUSCA. 777 

Pterotrachea FORSK., Firola BRUG., PERON. Body naked, elon- 
gate, with integument almost pellucid. Two eyes. Tentacles (very 
often) none. Head with a fleshy proboscis. Branchiae pinnate, 
free, at the posterior part of back.

Philadelphia, of which BLAINVILLE has made use in the article Firola, 
Dictionn. des Sc. nat. Tom. xvn. pp. 6268. Usually the tentacula are 
wanting. The species in which they are present were united by D'ORBIGNY 
under the name of Cerophora. Here belongs Firola caudina RANG,

According to D'ORBIGNY the singular genus Sagitta (see above, p. 246) 
should be placed here. 

Carinaria. Body elongate. Head with two long, subulate ten- 
tacles, and two sessile eyes behind the base of tentacles. A small 
shell at the posterior part of back, thin, pellucid, conical, com- 
pressed, with apex turned backward. 

These animals have much resemblance to the preceding genus, and 
CUVIER at first thought that the Pterotrachece described by FORSKAL had 
only accidentally lost their shell. Memoires, Moll. No. 18, p. 31. They 
differ, however, by the constant presence of two tentacles in front of the 
eyes and by small inequalities or tubercles on the skin.

of LINN.EUS, that the shell is not larger than a grain of sand, does not

B. Gasteropoda normalia. 

Foot serving for creeping, flattened or grooved. 

Section I. In some no distinct organs of respiration, in others 
naked dorsal branchiae, appendages or various productions of the 
common integuments. 

We part the common or normal Gasteropods into three divisions, accord- 
ing to their respiratory organs, and unite, as was proposed by the younger 
LEUCKART, the Gymnobranchiata and Apneusta under the name of Derma- 
tobranchiata of DUMERIL ; see K. LEUCKART Ueber Morphologic der wirbell. 
Thiere, 1848, s. 178. 

Family IV. Dermatobranchiata s. Crymnobranchiata. Cha- 
racters of the section. Naked Gasteropods, hermaphrodite, marine, 
often swimming on the back, with foot supine. 

The Nudibranchiates (nudibranckes) of CUVIER have been espe- 
cially investigated in the latest times. By QUATREFAGES, in many 
an intestinal canal divided into branches was discovered, or rather a 
branching appendage of the same, such as we have already noticed 
in Distoma, in some ringed worms, in Acarina, in Phalangium, &c. 
These blind branches discharge at the same time the office of liver. 
(QUATREFAGES gave to this arrangement the name of Phlebenterismus 
(see Ann. des Sc. nat., Sieme SeYie, Tom. iv. p. 83), which has caused 
much misconception.) In some it would seem that no heart is 
present ; whilst there are such conflicting opinions on this point, we 
consider it inexpedient to found an arrangement upon it, which 
might afterwards be subverted, and therefore cannot adopt the 
families of Anangia and Angiophora (V. SIEBOLD Lehrb. d. vergl. 
Anat. i. s. 297). As little do we feel ourselves justified in sepa- 
rating the Apneusta from the Gymnobranchiata. Those Gasteropods 
alone can be regarded as Apneusta, which, as Lissosoma, have no 
external dermal appendages.

animal first removed it to the Nudibranchiata. The form of the nervous 
system, the pouch-like appendages of the intestinal canal, and the disposition 
of the genital organs, all refer it to this division, although from the com- 
pressed form of the body the foot be not distinguishable from the rest of 
the integument. In the 2nd Edit, of his work VAN DER HOEVEN placed

The heart lies in these molluscs in the middle of the body on the 
dorsal surface, and receives the blood from the gills placed on each 
side. MILNE EDWARDS unites this family with the preceding and 
the next following into a common order under the name of Opis- 
thobranchia. This family approaches, however, very near to the 
preceding, and especially to the genera Doris and Tritonia.

This family, named by CUVIER Tectibranches, which was trans-

has no greater claim to this name, or even less than many other 
divisions of molluscs. We adopt therefore the name of Pleurobran- 
chiata instead of the sesquipedale of BLATNVILLE Monopleurobranchiata

Family VII. CydobrancJiiata. Gasteropods with branchiae

MOLLUSCA. 789 

Sexes distinct. Tongue long, linear, mostly beset densely with 
teeth and barbs. Shell resembling a shield, dorsal, not turbinated, 
with aperture ample. 

The position of the branchiae brings this family into the neigh- 
bourhood of the ffypobranchiata, and thus LAMARCK refers Patella 
and Chiton with Phyllidia to the same family. In other respects, 
however, there exists much difference amongst these animals, as at 
once appears from the disposition of the sexual organs, since in 
this division the sexes are distinct. Still, in a natural sequence of 
the animal kingdom, the Cyclobranchiata ought to form as it were 
the transition of the Ctenobranchiata to the three preceding families, 
the Opisthobranchiata of MILNE EDWARDS. 

That some individuals of Patella are female, others male, was observed 
by GEAT (Annals of Nat. Hist. i. p. 482), by MILNE EDWARDS (Annales 
des Sc. nat., 2e S^rie, xin. p. 376), by PETERS and ROBIN (MUELLER'S 
Archiv, 1846, s. 134) and by WAGNER (besides in Patella) also in Chiton 
(Annals of Nat. Hist. VI. p. 70). 

Chiton L. Shell multivalve, made up of (eight) testaceous 
scales arranged in a longitudinal row, incumbent on back. Mantle 
at the circumference not covered by shell, with margins hard, 
coriaceous, often aculeate or squamose. Ventral disc elongate, 
narrower than body. Eyes and tentacles none ; head crested by 
a wavy veil. 

With LINNAEUS there are three genera of Testacea multivalvia : 
Chiton, Lepas and Pholas. The last genus belongs to the Conchifera 
or Bivalvia ; Lepas is, as we stated above, a family of the Crustacea. 
Thus there remains the genus Chiton alone as a true multivalve 
mollusc. That it has no affinity or true similarity with the Cirri- 
pedia (Lepas L.), to which BLAINVILLE united it under the name of 
Malacoentoma, now requires no demonstration ; but many authors, 
both of earlier and later periods, still maintain that it differs too 
remarkably from the rest of the Gasteropods to allow it to remain 
in the neighbourhood of Patella, and that it forms the transition to 
the ringed worms (MiLNE EDWARDS Ann. des jSc. nat., 3e Se"rie, ix. 
1848, p. 110). It appears to us that these writers attach too much 
weight to the external resemblance of the pieces of shell to rings of 
articulate animals. In the internal structure there is, perhaps, with 
the exception of the remarkable occurrence of two oviducts (or vasa 
deferential), and two sexual apertures placed at the side, nothing to 
be met with that can indicate a remote affinity with the Articulate.

The species of this genus are very numerous and difficult to distinguish 
otherwise than by accurate measurements of the comparative length and 
breadth, the greater or lesser inequality &c. of the pieces of shell, and by 
the nature of the margins of the mantle which are not covered by the dor- 
sal shields. In some species these margins of the mantle cover, as though 
they came together by continued growth, the dorsal shields, so that the 
shell is concealed within them. Of these MIDDENDORFF forms the sub- 
genus Cryptochiton (Sp. Cryptochiton Stelleri MIDDEND. 1. 1. Taf. i. figs, i, 2, 
Chiton amiculatus SOWERBY, Conchol. Illustrations, Chitones, fig. 80, 
REEVE Conchologia system, n. PI. 132, 133, fig. 80; from which Chiton 
amiculatus PALL., according to MIDDEND., does not differ). The remaining 
species form the sub-genus Phcenochiton MIDDEND., in which the branchiae 
are sometimes situated backwards and the row of pieces of shell is inter- 
rupted by the mantle (Dichachiton MIDDEND., Chitonellus LAM., Sp. Chito- 
nellus Icevis LAM., BLAINV. Malac. PI. 87, fig. 5) ; or the pieces of shell close 
upon one another and the branchiae are placed round about at the sides of the 
mantle (Hamachiton MIDDEND.) To this last division belong most of the 
species of the genus Chiton of LAMARCK. On account of its size we notice 
Chiton gigas SPENGL., CHEMN. Conchyl. Tab. 96, fig. 819, Encycl. meth.,

of Nat. Hist. xx. 1847, p. 131 and foil. 

Patella L. (exclusive of several species). Shell univalve, 
covering body entirely above, clypeate or retuso-conical. Branchiae 
placed under the margin of mantle, lamellose, lateral, disposed in a 
series surrounding the body. Head with two tentacles acuminate, 
bearing the eyes externally at their base. 

Limpets. A very numerous genus of molluscs. The intestinal canal 
which, as in the preceding genus, is very long and forms many convolutions 
runs with the rectum upwards, so that the vent is placed under the head 
on the right side, whilst in Chiton it lies in the mid line at the posterior 
extremity of the body. The nervous system presents a band lying trans- 
versely upon the oesophagus and swelling on each side into a ganglion, 
from which the nerves for the eyes, the feelers and the neighbouring parts 
arise. Two nervous filaments descend on each side and form a transverse 
ganglion, from which nerves arise for the foot, the viscera and the circular 
muscle that attaches the animal firmly to its shell. Compare CUVIER Mem. 
sur les Mollusq. No. 18, pp. 15 19, PI. n. figs. 8 19, and the fig. of

NematobrancTiia MENEE (Cirrobranchiata BLAINV.). (An ab-

Dentalium L. Shell tubular, elongato-conical, subarcuate, per- 
vious at both extremities, with posterior aperture narrow, a fissure 
often extending upon the shell. Animal conical, eyes none, bran- 
chiae composed of many cirri arranged in two fasciculi. 

The genus Dentalium, placed by LINN.EUS with Patella, and referred by 
later writers to the ringed worms, belongs in reality, according to the 
investigations of SAVIGNT and DESHATES, to the Mollusca, although it is 
difficult to unite that genus with any of the other families. It forms a 
small group between the Heteropoda and Asplddbranchiata (Emarginula). 
The species are numerous ; many are extinct, and occur in various tertiary 
and secondary formations.

Sub-genus : Haliotis LAM. Shell perforate by a row of foramina 
near the left margin, pearly within. 

Sea-ears. Feelers pass through the holes of the shell. These 
holes are closed up in the hinder part of the shell as the animal 
grows, and at the same time new ones are formed more forwards. 



MOLLUSCA. 793 

In front, in the margin, an excision is seen in the direction of the 
holes, which afterwards, during the growth, becomes changed into 
a hole. The ventral disc or foot is adorned with a double row of 
feelers, tubercles, and fringes. The animal is attached to the shell 
by a large oval muscle. The branchial cavity opens by a fissure of 
the mantle on the right side, under the foremost holes of the shell.

three branchiae, two or a single one, composed of numerous leaves, 
arranged parallel like the teeth of a comb. 

Very rarely, in place of branchiae a vascular network in the walls 
of respiratory cavity. Sexes separate, external organs of copula- 
tion distinct. 

Pectinibranchiates. In all two feelers and two eyes are present ; 
these last are often pediculate. The mouth has the form of a pro- 
boscis, of which the structure has been described at length by 
CUVIER in the whelk (Euccinum). It consists of two tubes, which 
push one into the other and are connected together by the upper 
margin, so that when the innermost tube is unrolled and elongated, 
the outermost becomes shorter. This instrument is moved by many 
muscles 1 . The hinder part of the body contains the liver and the 
sexual organs. The sexes are distinct. In the male the penis is 
situated on the right side, behind the head, and in some, as in the 
whelk, is very large. It is folded round and concealed in the respi- 
ratory cavity, but is not retracted within the body, except in the 
genus Pcdudina, where it is protruded and retracted through an 
aperture in the right tentacle, which had been observed already by 
LISTER, but was afterwards incorrectly denied by DRAPARXAUD. 
Through the penis runs a tortuous canal, which on copulation, 
when that organ is erected, probably loses its tortuosities. Ac- 
cording to B ASTER and BLAINVILLE, the shells indicate a difference 
of sex, and those of the female are wider, particularly in the last 
wreath 2 . 

The females secrete a kind of common envelope for the eggs, 
which they deposit at the same time with the eggs. On our shores 
round clumps of yellow vesicles may be frequently observed, which 
resemble bunches of grapes, and are the masses of whelk's eggs in 
question 3 . According to CUVIER, this envelope is secreted by a

wreaths, but which are thinner than those of the female.

The species of this genus are very numerous. Those which shine nacreous 
and silvery within, with a mostly very thick operculum, are more espe- 
cially named Turbo, as Turbo clirysostomus L., HUMPH. Amb. Rariteitlc.

The species which have no nacreous splendour internally, and which 
have constantly a horny operculum, are united under the following sub- 
genus.

is perforated in the male individuals with an aperture which gives passage 
to the penis. The gills consist of three series of filaments. This snail, com- 
mon in fresh water, is viviparous, and the females are full of young in 
spring. It is found in Holland in canals and other fresh water, in the 
mud or hiding under stones, also creeping under water-plants, &c. [Con-

fossil species from the tertiary formations. 

These animals differ from the rest of this family, inasmuch as they do 
not live in water, but in moist places, and breathe atmospheric air. Also 
they have a vascular net in place of gills, and on this account might 
belong to the following family, if the whole form of the body and the 
internal structure did not remove them from the Pneumonica and place 
them in the neighbourhood of Turbo. 

Helicina LAM. 

Ampullaria LAM. Shell globose, ventricose, umbilicate, with 
spire short, obtuse, sometimes discoidal. Aperture entire, oblong. 
Animal furnished with operculum, with long tentacles, and petiolate 
eyes at the base of tentacles. Respiratory cavity large, containing 
a pectinate branchia composed of a row of lamella, and a vascular 
pulmonary cavity.

arcuate near the columella, the apex acuminate. Operculum 
horny. Tentacles elongate. Eyes placed at the base of tenta- 
cles. Foot oblong, anteriorly truncated, posteriorly acuminate. 

This genus consists of small marine animals, whose little shell has some 
resemblance to Turbo or Scalaria, and of which the numerous species have 
become known in the last few years alone; there are also many fossil 
species, almost all from the tertiary formations. Compare DESHAYES in

margin is smooth; such is the case in Ovula volva LAM., Sulla Volva L., 
BLAINV., 1. 1. fig. 3, where it terminates at both sides in a long tube. 

Cyprma L. Shell involute, polished, convex above, flattened

Porcelain shells. A very numerous genus (about -200 species are known), 
which is defined very naturally. The shell of the young animal differs 
much from that of the adult ; it is thin, differently coloured and without 
teeth at the aperture, the wreaths also being then visible (see above, p. 
687, and compare the figure of Cyprosa exanthema in the young state,

Section III. Cavity for respiration furnished with a network

Family XI. Pneumomca(C(kpnoa$CHWEiG.). Hermaphrodite 
molluscs breathing air, most of them terrestrial, others aquatile, 
ascending to the surface of the water for respiration. Some naked, 
others testaceous. 

This division of Molluscs is treated of at length in the illustrated work of 
DE FERUSSAC, Histoire natur. des Mollusques terrestres et fluviatiles, Paris, 
1819 and foil. DESHAYES, after the death of FERUSSAC, began the con- 
tinuation which was completed in 1851. 

I. Operculum.

Note. Shell of Amputtaria. Head bilobed, with rounded lobes in place 
of tentacles. Here belong the species of Ampullaria (Ampull. avellana and 
Amp. frar/ilis) of LAMARCK. The genus seems to me to be of uncertain 
position. 

II. Operculum none true. 

Phalanx I. Eyes at the base of tentacles. Two tentacles 
only. The most aquatic. 

Ancylus GEOFFR. Shell thin, obliquely conical, with apex 
acute, inflected posteriorly. Aperture oval, with margins very 
simple. Creeping body entirely covered by shell.

Concerning the place of this genus in the natural arrangement opinions 
are at variance. TREVIRANUS thought, from the anatomical investigation 
of Ancyl. fluviatilis, that the genus might indeed have some affinity with 
Lymnceus, but still does not belong to the pneumonica, because on the left 
side, between the mantle and the border of the ventral disc, a gill is situated 



812 CLASS XIII. 

in form of a long leaf. TREVIRANUS, accordingly, compares this animal 
with Pleurobranchus, but remarks at the same time that in this last genus 
the gill lies on the right side, and has many transverse folds, whilst that of 
Ancylus presents an entirely smooth surface. (Zeitschr. fur Physiologic, iv. 
i, 1822, s. 192 197, Taf. xvii.). TROSCHEL refers Ancylus to the Hypo- 
branchiata (see WIEGMANN'S Archiv, 1838, n. s. 285). But since, however, 
VOGT has subsequently remarked, that these animals appear to breathe air 
alone, and that it has by no means been proved that the leaf-like organ is 
really to be regarded as a gill (MUELLER'S Archiv, 1841, s. 25 28), we still 
think that Ancylus must remain amongst the pneunionica aquatilia. 

Limnceus Cuv., Lymncea LAM. Tentacles broad, short, com- 
pressed, triangular, not retractile. Eyes placed between the bases 
of tentacles. Shell thin, oblong, sometimes turrite; spire exsert. 
Aperture entire, longitudinal. Labrum acute, ascending towards 
columella and forming an oblique fold. 

Mud-snail. These animals have a thin shell; the last wreath is very 
wide and round. On the right side of the animal is the respiratory aper- 
ture, the walls of which can be elongated as a tube, and thus extend above 
the water. Such is the case when the animal respires at the surface of the 
water, with the foot or the ventral disc turned upwards. The apertures of 
the sexual organs lie far apart. Under the right feeler is the aperture 
which transmits the penis, under the respiratory aperture that of the female 
organs. To this it is to be ascribed that in copulating one individual is 
connected with two others, one of which impregnates it whilst the other is 
impregnated by it. In this way, hanging together, they often form several 
long chains. (Vox BAER has, however, observed self-impregnation also in 
Limnceus auricularis, MUELLER'S Archiv, n. 1835, s. 224.) These snails 
live on water-plants.

compressed into a margin on each side (carinated).

grand Escargot. The name Pomatia, from IIwyu,a, cover (cochlea opercularis), 
was given to this animal on account of the closure of the aperture of the 
shell in winter that occurs in this and other species. In autumn the animal 
retracts itself within the shell, and then a false operculum (epiphragma) is 
secreted, which is pushed off in spring when the snail again creeps out of 
its house. During the winter these snails in our temperate climate take no 
food, but lie asleep ; in like manner, in tropical regions the species of this 
genus in the dry months fall into a state of insensibility.

Wirceburgi, 1813, 4to. In all the species of Helix there is found in the 
neighbourhood of the sexual organs a thick-walled pear-shaped purse, in 
which a dart-shaped calcareous stile is contained ; this organ is annually 
renewed, just like the cover of the mouth of the shell.

Half a century ago a slug-like animal was first discovered by BUCHANAN 
in Bengal, on the leaves of Typha elephantina, to which, on account of the 
many small tubercles on the back, he gave the generic name cited above 
(derived from 6yKos). See Linn. Trans, v. pp. 132134. The animal dis- 
covered by B. has not, to my knowledge, been described more particularly 
by any later observer ; the animals to which CUVIER gave this generic name 
live in the sea near the shore, and also come on land. According to 
EHRENBERG (Symbol. physic., Evertebr. i.) there are seen behind on the back 
arborescent appendages which contract when the animal is on dry land and 
which may be regarded as gills. This animal may thus form the transition 
to the Gymnobranchiata and have an affinity to Doris.

which the oesophagus passes and of which the uppermost part covers

the cerebral ganglion, the lowest contains the auditory organs, and 
the lateral parts, broad and excavated like a cup, receive the eyes. 
The orbits are guarded in front by two elongated cartilaginous plates, 
which are attached by their base to the cartilaginous ring and else- 
where are extended freely over those cavities. In the Sepia there is 
an additional triangular cartilage, of which the point is attached to the 
ring, the base turned towards the arms, and to which the muscles 
of the arms are affixed. In Sepia and Loligo there are further 
found two catilaginous plates on the back, and, on each side of the 
body, an elongated flat cartilage which supports the lateral expan- 
sions of the mantle or the fins \ In the Nautilus there is only one 
cartilage present in the head, which lies beneath the oesophagus, but 
does not enclose this annularly, and is prolonged on each side to the 
funnel. The eyes, which in this genus are placed on pedicles at the 
side of the head, are not protected by this cartilage. 

The head of these molluscs is round and broad and separated by 
a constriction, as by a neck, from the body. Around the mouth are 
placed in most eight or ten arms; in Nautilus, on the contrary, 
several membranous sheath-like appendages, perforated internally, 
in which thin cylindrical tentacles, capable of extension and retrac- 
tion, are inclosed. Where eight or ten arms are present, eight of 
them have constantly a somewhat conical form and stand in a circle 
round the mouth. On the upper surface, that which faces towards 
the mouth, these eight arms are covered with numerous suckers, by 
which they attach themselves to different bodies. (In the ten-armed 
two are placed on the outside beyond the circle of the other eight on 
the ventral surface, and can by retortion be drawn entirely within 
the body. Already had ARISTOTLE distinguished these two from the 
other arms under the name of proboscides.} The arms are hollow 
internally, for the passage of the artery and nerve ; radiating mus- 
cular fibres run from the middle outwards, and on the surface is a 
layer of circular and longitudinal muscular fibres, by which all the 
various motions of retraction, contraction, flexure and convolution 
become possible, which, on the seizure of prey, are executed by 
these organs. 

Under the head is situated a conical organ, which is open at the 
extremity, the funnel (infundibulwm) formed by an extension of the 
mantle and provided with muscular walls. In Nautilus it has two

margins, like a rolled leaf, free beneath, which are thrown one over 
the other ; in the other Cephalopods it opens at the anterior extremity 
alone. Below, this funnel passes into the cavity within which the 
gills are situated, and into which the terminations of the sexual 
organs and of the intestinal canal open. The contraction of the 
funnel forces out the water at its opening below the head. Before 
the opening there is usually placed a valvular organ (not unlike an 
epiglottis), by which the reflux of the water is prevented. 

The mouth lies in the middle between the arms, surrounded by a 
circular fold of skin. Here are seen two large, curved, horny jaws, 
which resemble in some degree the bill of a parrot, and of which the 
lower overlaps the upper and smaller. Between the jaws is placed 
a membranous tongue, which is soft at the point and beset with 
papillae, but elsewhere is covered with hard, horny plates and 
spines. In the sac of the mantle most of the viscera (with exception 
of the gills) are situated in a proper cavity, which is distinct from 
that of the gills that opens externally through the funnel. 

The respiratory organs are two or four gills, which, pointed coni- 
cally, run obliquely upwards, and are situated, one or two on each 
side, in the base of the sac, which terminates in the funnel. They 
are affixed here to a fleshy, projecting margin, and consist of mem- 
branous leaflets, incised at the edge, each of which is affixed by a 
separate stalk to the projecting margin. In those that have only 
two gills, a venous heart is situated at the base of each of these; in 
the Nautilus, that has four gills, these two venous hearts are not 
present. On the large venous stems which conduct the venous 
blood towards the gills, spongy appendages, usually of a brown- 
yellow colour, united in bundles, and sometimes subdivided blind 
folliculi, which we noticed above (p. 760) as kidneys, are situated. 
The cavities in which these veins lie, are washed by water that has a 
free access to them through special apertures in the branchial cavity. 

The sexual organs, in both sexes, are situated in the base or pos- 
terior extremity of the visceral sac. The ovarium is in all single, 
although in many two oviducts are present, which then, however, 
arise from a short common canal. This ovary consists of a sac with 
thick walls, on the inside of which, the eggs inclosed in proper cap- 
sules, are affixed by pedicles. For the secretion of the envelop of 
the eggs there is a glandular organ, which in Octopus surrounds each 
oviduct, or the walls of the oviduct itself are thickened towards the 
extremity by a glandular tissue which supplies the same secretion. 
One or two glands composed of many laminae, which however are 

522 



820 CLASS XIIT. 

wanting in Octopus, are present in females, without any connexion 
with the oviduct, and probably secrete an external covering, or an 
adhesive substance, by which the eggs are attached to each other. 
The testis in the male agrees for the most part with the ovary in 
external form and in situation. It presents a sac in which a bundle 
of glandular tubes that secrete the seed is found. The efferent duct 
is narrow and very tortuous, and afterwards passes into a wider 
canal with internal folds, into which also an elongated gland 
(prostata ?) situated laterally effuses its secretion. This canal termi- 
nates in a muscular purse with thin walls, in which lie whitish cy- 
lindrical bodies, about half an inch, and sometimes much more in 
length, and which move when they are moistened long after the 
death of the animal : which motion NEEDHAM has fully described 1 . 

NEEDHAM compares these singular little machines, as he names the 
organs, with the Spermatozoa of other animals, from which however they 
differ in their size and their composite structure. This is not exactly the 
same in the various genera, yet it agrees in the chief point that in the 
cylindrical body an elongated sac with thin walls and filled with a white 
fluid (sperma) is situated, and extends to one of its extremities, whilst at 
the other end there is a filament, turned spirally, and contained in a long 
thin tube, which, after a pear-shaped expansion, is attached by a short 
pedicle to the elongated sac at the other extremity. On contact with water 
the cylindrical body is opened, probably by endosmose, and this occasions 
the expulsion of the spiral organ which draws out with it the attached sac. 
Within the sac is contained a white sperma with cylindrical spermatozoa 
terminating in a long fine filament. The Needhamian bodies are thus not 
spermatozoa, but they contain spermatozoa; they are seed-machines, capsulce 
seminis or spermatophores, as MILNE EDWAKDS has named them 2 . 

The male Cephalopods have a short, very thick, conical and per- 
forate penis, which is situated at the side of the rectum at the same 
part where the extremity of the oviduct lies in the females attached

are named Needhamian bodies, although they had been previously observed by 
SWAMMERDAM (Bijbel der Nat. Tab. LII. figs. 6, 7). Some regard these little cylinders 
as real animals ; see G. C. CARUS Needhamia expulsoria sepice officinalis, beschreiben

in the gill-sac. Whether an introduction of this organ into the 
funnel of the female takes place, is not sufficiently cleared up. 

[In certain genera of Cephalopods there is a very remarkable ac- 
cessory organ of propagation in the males, which we now proceed to 
notice. Amongst the doubtful genera of Entozoa (p. 188) Hectoco- 
tylus is recorded. It was first noticed by DELLE CHIAJE in Argo- 
nauta 1 , and by him referred to the genus Trichocephalus by the 
name of Trichocephalus acetabularis. Afterwards what was sup- 
posed to be another species of the same genus was detected in Octo- 
pus granulosus LAM. by LAURILLARD, and described by CuviER 2 . 
This presented more than 100 suckers, whereas that of DELLE 
CHIAJE had only 35, whence it was named by CUVIER Hectocotyle 
from eicaroRi KoELLiKER 3 , from his examinations of the Hectocotylus 
of Argonauta, and of another discovered by VERANY in Tremoctopus 
violaceus, declared it to be the male individual of these animals 
respectively, and not a parasite. This opinion was afterwards 
shewn to be unfounded, for YERANY* found in several specimens of 
a Cephalopod, called by him Octopus Carena (male Oct. granulosus 
LAM.), that the 3rd arm on the right side was longer and thicker 
than the rest, and had a bladder at its extremity, whilst PHILIPPI, 
in a specimen examined by him, saw the same arm fall off on being 
touched, and found it to resemble exactly the Hectocotylus described 
by CUVIER, 

At an early period the Hectocotylus arm is developed in its future 
position in a pediculated vesicle in which it is rolled up. The 
vesicle alone contains chromatophores 5 . As the development pro- 
ceeds, the containing vesicle or bladder shews a fissure on that side 
which is towards the mouth of the Cephalopod from which the hec- 
tocotylus emerges j but since the latter is attached throughout a con- 
siderable portion of its length to the inner surface of the other side of 
the bladder, this last is turned inside out when the hectocotylus has 
escaped, and continues to be attached to it on its dorsal surface. The 
structure of the hectocotylus is the same as that already described of 
the other arms, except that in the central canal is an elongated mus- 
cular pouch, closed at the near end and terminating in a fine tube, 
and that there is a filament at the end of the hectocotylus (which has

been developed in its own proper vesicle within the larger bladder, and 
of which the remains continue attached at the extremity of the hec- 
tocotylus after it has allowed the filament to escape). The filament is 
tubular, its cavity is continuous with that of the hectocotylus, and is 
open at its extremity. The tube of the elongated pouch runs in the 
central cavity of the hectocotylus and of its continuation, the fila- 
ment, and opens at the extremity of the latter externally. The 
pouch or sac is found, when the hectocotylus is fully developed, to 
contain a spermatophore, and it was the presence of spermatozoa 
and of an organ apparently for the secretion of them in the interior 
of the hectocotylus, when found attached to the respiratory cavity of 
the Argonauta, that induced KOELLIKER to suppose the Hectocotylus 
to be the male of the Argonauta. H. MUELLER found this Hectoco- 
tylus in its state of imperfect development on that male, which is 
much smaller than the female, and has no shell 1 . The hectocotylus 
arm is the second of the left side in A. Argo, the third of the right 
side in Octopus granulosus, (Tremoctopus Carena VER.) whilst the 
hectocotylus only, and not the male of Tremoctopus violaceus DELLE 
CHIAJE, has hitherto been discovered. 

The sexual organs of the hectocotyliferous males are constructed 
on exactly the same plan as those of the males of ordinary Cephalo- 
pods. The vas deferens opens at last into the respiratory sac, so 
that the idea of a communication between it and the sac of the hec- 
tocotylus arm, entertained by some, is untenable. How then is the 
spermatophore transferred to this sac 1 ? VoGT 2 thinks that the spot- 
ted pocket (the bladder in which the hectocotylns was originally de- 
veloped, and which is now turned inside out, with a fissure 
through which the arm has passed) serves as a receptacle for the 
spermatophore, which has been transferred to it by the long filament 
of the hectocotylus embracing it ; at the same time he denies the ex- 
istence of the muscular sac in the interior. LEUCKART 3 , however, 
has established the existence of this last, and has found a communi- 
cation between the spotted bladder and the side of the muscular sac 
attached to it, namely a canal by which they communicate. It is not

impossible that the spermatophore may be transferred in some cases, 
in the way supposed by VOGT, but not always. For the spermatophore 
has been found in the hectocotylus, whilst the filament was yet in- 
closed in its proper sac. In this case the other arms may have 
effected the transfer, as LEUCKART conjectures. After it has been 
brought thus far, the propulsive force of the spiral portion of the 
spermatophore must be supposed to come into play in order to begin 
the passage through the tube of communication with the muscular 
pouch of the hectocotylus, whose walls are also muscular. The fila- 
ment at the end of the hectocotylus has been very generally supposed 
to act as a penis. H. MUELLER found as many as six of them 
within the capsule of the ovary in Argonauta Clio, that had been 
broken off', and two others in one of the oviducts, so that no fewer 
than eight males would seem to have fecundated this individual. 

It is presumed that when the hectocotylus arm has been cast off, 
it may be successively reproduced.] 

The eggs are laid in heaps, or are connected with each other in 
clusters by pedicles and an adhesive substance. In this respect 
great variety prevails in the different genera. In Loligo, many eggs 
are united in strings of a gelatinous substance; in Sepia they are 
very large and surrounded by a horny dark envelop, which is pro- 
duced into a pedicle at one extremity, and by which the eggs are 
attached to each other, or to foreign bodies. 

In the development of the embryo, when the egg has been laid, 
grooves are formed in that part of the yolk where was previously 
the germinal vesicle, and which do not extend over the whole 
yolk. Here the embryo afterwards appears as a disciform germ, at 
first flat and round, in which, at an early period, different inequali- 
ties indicate the first existence of the mantle, of the eyes, and of the 
funnel, formed at first of two separate halves. This germ-disc be- 
gins to swell gradually in the center, extends itself constantly further 
towards the circumference, and finally surrounds the entire yolk. 
In this way a part of the yolk-sac between the arms at the ventral 
surface is included in the mantle, so that afterwards an internal as 
well as an external yolk-sac is found, the two being connected by a 
narrow pedicle 2 . 

1 [Op. cit. p. 354.] 

8 Formerly it was supposed that the yolk-sac is connected with the mouth by means 
of this pedicle (CAVOLINI) ; CUVIER presumed a connexion with the oesophagus ; see 
his memoir sur Us ceufs de Seiches. Nouv. Ann. du MM. I. 1832, pp. 153 160, PL 8. 
The chief work that we now possess on the development of these animals and from 
which we have borrowed what has been announced, is A. KOELLIKER Entwickelungt- 
geschichte der Cephalopoden, Zurich, 1843, 4*- 



824 CLASS xin. 

The nervous system is largely developed in the Cephalopoda, and 
in most of the genera the central mass for the head (the cerebral 
mass) is enclosed in the cartilaginous ring, which we have already 
noticed. Beneath the oesophagus a considerable nerve-mass is situ- 
ated, which in Nautilus is divided into two transverse bands, one in 
front of the other. From the anterior portion of this central mass 
(or from the first of the two half-rings, situated under the oesopha- 
gus in Nautilus) the nervous trunks for the arms arise, or for the 
tentacles surrounding the head. In Octopus, Sepia, and Loligo, 
these anterior portions form on each side a large, flat ganglion, from 
the anterior margin of which the brachial nerves of that side radiate 
(ganglions en patte d'oie CUVIER). From the posterior portion arise 
at the side thick nervous stems for the mantle, which in Loligo, 
Sepia, Octopus, &c. terminate in two large ganglia, from which the 
nerves radiate at acute angles; in Nautilus these lateral ganglia 
stellata are wanting. In addition there arise from the middle of 
the posterior margin of this portion two nervous trunks, at first laid 
close together, from which the nerves for the viscera arise. From 
the portion situated above the oesophagus nerves arise for the mus- 
cular mass that surrounds the jaws, or these come from the ganglion 
of the sympathetic system placed above the oesophagus (ganglion 
pharyngeurti) as in Sepia and Loligo. From the lateral commissures 
of this portion, by which it is connected with the central mass situ- 
ated beneath the oesophagus, the two remarkable optic nerves arise, 
which terminate in kidney-shaped ganglia; lower down arise the 
two short auditory nerves which penetrate into the cartilaginous 
ring of the head. The sympathetic nervous system has a ganglion 
(ganglion labiale) seated under the oesophagus, and one on the sto- 
mach formed by the union of two nervous stems. 

On the organs of sense in this order, what we have stated above 
(pp. 766 768) may be referred to. The skin of the Cephalopods is 
distinguished by a change of colour exhibited during the life of the 
animal, and depending upon a peculiar stratum of saccules filled 
with pigment-granules (chromatophores of SANGIOVANNI and WAG- 
NER), which are connected by a delicate, elastic, membranous tissue. 
These organs lie immediately under the cuticle, and by alternate 
contraction of the vesicles, containing red, blue, or yellow colouring 
matter, a lively play of colour arises in definite situations, especially 
in Loligo and Argonauta 1 .

inside it is whitish with a pearly lustre, on the outside milk-white, with 
orange or red-brown stripes. This species, the only one of the seventeen 
species recorded by LINNAEUS that has remained in the genus Nautilus, is 
found in the Indian Ocean, the Islands of the Moluccan Archipelago, &c. 
Nautilus umbilicatus LAM., in the shell of which the last wreath does not 
cover that which precedes it, is in other respects comformable to the above. 

Notwithstanding the shell is not altogether rare, the animal of the pearly 
Nautilus was, until within the last few years, known only from a very im- 
perfect figure of EUMPHIUS. OWEN was the first who gave a good descrip- 
tion and a careful anatomy of this interesting animal (Memoir on the pearly 
Nautilus, with illustrations of its external form and internal structure. 
London, 1832, 4to). Besides the characters already given above, it is dis- 
tinguished from the rest of the CephaJopods now living by the absence of 
the Ink-sac. The head is covered by a large membranous hood, which 
represents exactly the circumference of the aperture of the shell, and arises 
from the expansion and coalescence of the cases of the uppermost pair of 
tentacles. The pediculated eye is partly covered by the over-hanging margin 
of the hood. Beside the 19 or 20 larger external tentacles, the mouth is 
surrounded by two pairs of flat, finger-shaped lappets, each of which encloses 
12 1 6 smaller tentacles, but in other respects similar in structure to the 
larger. If a male specimen observed by me be not a monstrosity, then it 
may be concluded that in these organs a sexual difference is presented ;

of Zool. Soc. iv. 1851, pp. 26, 27. [From letters of VAN DER HOEVEN, 
July and Sept. 1855, it appears that the above was no abnormity but the 
usual conformation of the males. " I have had the opportunity," he adds, 
" of examining recently two other male specimens, and hope to have time 
to publish this year or the following, some new observations on the struc- 
ture .... The male differs from the female by the absence in the mantle of 
the lamellated glandular apparatus (OwEN's Mem. p. 43, PI. vin. fig. 10), 
and by a different number of the digitations. (These are less numerous in 
the female.) A chief difference, however, is the presence of the great 
conoid body at the left side (see my Contributions, p. 27, PI. 7, figs. 10, n). 
This singular body has at the extremity and on the outside a large disc 
perforated by the orifices of numerous crypts. As the spermatophores 
(NEEDHAM'S machines) after their passage through the penis are inclosed 
in a bag formed of two coats, of a brown colour, and of nearly half an 
inch in diameter, I believe that the glandular apparatus may secrete this 
envelop, and that consequently it is a physiological analogon of the glan- 
dular apparatus described by OWEN in the mantle of the female. The fold 
connecting the labial processes at the inferior side above the funnel is in 
the male of a different conformation, (see Contrib. pp. 26, 27). The fine 
folds of the external labial processes are totally wanting, and instead of the 
so-called olfactory organ at the commissure of the internal labial processes, 
there is the cushion-like part (with 8 ir digitations), (Contrib. PI. 8, fig. 9). 
As to the internal genital organs of the male, a large gland (testis), which 
in bulk surpasses all the other organs of the body, except the liver, is 
situated exactly where the ovary is in the female ; another smaller, flat 
gland, more at the fore part, seems to secrete the spermatophora ; a bag 
with an imperfect internal septum receives these spermatophorce and brings 
them to the conical penis, which is situated not exactly, but nearly, as is 
the vulva (more in the mid-plane)."] 

The genus Nautilus occurs also fossil in secondary and tertiary formations. 
It is the only genus still extant of a very numerous division of the Cepha- 
lopoda, which lived in the seas of a former world and of which the remains 
are met with in mountain strata, especially in the older secondary forma- 
tions. Here belong the Ammonites.

within the shell as Nautilus is, the siphon would lie on the ventral side 
towards the margin of the funnel, and the expression Sipho dorsalis, used 
by Palaeontologists, is consequently incorrect. Ammonites are met with in 
great numbers, especially in the transition and older secondary formations. 
In the lowest chalk-strata they are still numerous, but afterwards decrease 
rapidly and after the chalk-periods are met with no more on our earth.

In this division of Cephalopods, to which most of the species now 
living belong, the funnel is closed below. There is an organ for the 
secretion of a black fluid, which the animal can eject through the fun- 
nel, the ink- sac. In the genus Octopus this ink-sac is enclosed within 
the liver } but in the rest is remote from it. The colouring matter of 
some species is used as a paint, Sepia. Since some observations have 
indicated the presence of an ink-sac in the fossil Belemnites l , it may 
probably be concluded, with OWEN, that these petrifactions are in- 
ternal shells of Cephalopoda dibranchiata, which conclusion has, in 
fact, been since established by the observation of petrified animals 2 . 

Family XIII. Decacera s. Sepiacea. Arms ten, two longer 
than the rest, round. 

Belemnites BREYN, LAM. Shell fossil, conical, including inter- 
nally a multilocular, shorter portion (alveolites) . 

Belemnites or dart-stones; thus named on account of their dart- like form. 
These petrifactions are found abundantly in the secondary mountains of 
the oolite and chalk-periods. Compare, amongst others, DUCROTAY DE

Of this shell the- animal is known from only imperfect figures, and some 
specimens not entirely perfect. See E. J. GRAY Annals of Nat. Hist. xv. 
PP- 2 57 2 6o, PI. xv. A mutilated specimen, investigated by OWEN in 
1848, has afforded, however, by the anatomical particulars of internal 
structure the certainty that the animal resembles the Sepiacea or Decacera. 
There are two gills, two lateral or venous hearts, an ink-sac, a membranous 
tubular siphon, &c. See R. OWEN in Zoology of the Voyage of H. M. S.

Rossia OWEN. 

Loligopsis LAM., Perothis ESCHSCHOLTZ, RATHKE. 

LAMARCK has described this genus as having only eight arms ; the long 
tentacula are often torn off. In common with Cranchia this genus has no 
membranous valve in the funnel. These animals are nearly transparent ; 
the eight arms are short ; the body is conical, posteriorly narrow and with 
two round fins at the extremity. Compare RATHKE Perothis ein neues 
Genus der Cephalopoden, Mem. presentes a I'Acad. imper. des Sc. de St Peters- 
burg, n. 1835, pp. 149176. 

Cranchia LEACH. 

Sp. Cranchia scabra LEACH in TUCKET'S Exped, to the River Zaire, p. 410. 
The fins are situated quite at the end of the body and the dorsal surface of 
the mantle is grown fast to the head. 

Family XIV. Octocera s. Octopoda. Arms eight, large, often 
very long, surrounding the mouth in a circular row. Body sacci- 
form, without fins. Funnel without valve. 

Argonauta L. Arms furnished with a double row of acetabula 
(suckers), the two superior expanded into a membrane towards the 
extremity. Shell thin, involute, external, unilocular, with spire 
bicarinate. 

This remarkable shelled animal excited long ago the admiration of the 
ancients ; see PLINIUS Hist. Nat. ix. cap. 29. It was supposed that it made 
use of its fin-shaped arms as a sail, and thus in still weather could swim on 
the surface of the sea; but the observations of RANG (GUEEIN Magazin 
de Zool. I837 1 ) have not confirmed this opinion; these arms lie expanded 
along the outside of the shell and serve to fasten the animal in its shell, 
which is not attached to it by any muscles. Many naturalists (RAFINESQUE, 
LEACH and others) thought, that this animal like the hermit-crab (Pagurus) 
lived parasitically in a borrowed shell, and that the shell of Argonauta 
belonged to some unknown species of mollusc. Accordingly this genus of 
Octopoda was named as a new genus Ocythoe. Although this animal can 
readily move from its shell, just like some Pteropoda, this opinion is now, 
however, sufficiently refuted. For the discrepant form of the male indivi- 
duals which have no shell see above, p. 820 823. 

On the anatomy of Argonauta compare POLI Test. utr. Sicil. Tom. in. 
and VAN BENEDEN Nouv. Mem. de I'Academie royale des Sc. de Bruxelles, 
Tom. XT. 1833. 



1 POLI adopts this notion of the ancients, and he has even figured the animal in 
accordance with it (Testae, utr. Sicil. III. Tab. 40), but says that he has never himself 
seen the sails of the Argonauta.

inclosed in mantle. (Polypus of the ancients.) 

Amongst these naked eight-armed Cephalopods there were some species 
of which, as in the last, females alone were known, and of these it is that 
the hectocotylus of the male (now in some instances known) has been found 
attached in the sac of the mantle or in the funnel, as Octopus granulosu*
